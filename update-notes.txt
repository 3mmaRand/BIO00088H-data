Helper code:
if you want to generate a bib file, you can use bibtex::write.bib for uplaoding to your ref manager

deps <- renv::dependencies()
pkgs <- setdiff(unique(deps$Package), "R")
bibtex::write.bib(entry = pkgs, file = "references_libs.bib", append = FALSE)

You need to do external_gene_name %in% ....
where ... is a list of the gene names

WEEK 6

reminder on organising work
folders for different types of data
make inuts and outputs clear
include all inputs and outputs
you will be submitting either:
-  an RStudio project (i.e., a folder structure 
containing an .RProj in the top folder

-  a folderstructure which includes an RStudio Project

not one correct organisationbut should be as self-explanatory 
as possible

self explanatory does not mean youdon't explain. it means you
save people mental load

Curate your and reorganise your code
- does it make sense to use more than one script
- do any of your files need renaming and reorganising
- do any variables need renaming for consistency
- remember you want to be systematic
- write down conventions you decide to follow
- go through week 2 and apply

restart R to try. exchange projects with a friend. Do they understand?
