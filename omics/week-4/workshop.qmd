# The Code file

These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not
visible on the webpage.

The [workshop.qmd](workshop.qmd) file is the file I use to compile the
practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary
text to be interleaved to produce well-formatted reports including
webpages. Right-click on the link and choose Save-As to download. You
will be able to open the Qmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in
Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/). Coding and thinking answers are
marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

Pages made with R [@R-core], Quarto [@allaire2022], `knitr` [@knitr],
`kableExtra` [@kableExtra]
