## Omics workshops

What the data are and something about what has been done to the raw data to get get.



-   üê∏ the difference between the control and the FGF treated sibling at
    S30
-   üê≠ the difference between HSPC and Prog cells
-   üçÇ ???????

## Aims

-   find important genes
-   what is 'important'
    -   expressed
    -   differentially expressed i.e., which genes are significantly higher in one group vs another




## Sequence Data

-   The raw data are "reads" from a sequencing machine. Reads are short sequences of DNA or RNA. 


-   The reads are aligned to a reference genome or transcriptome. The reads are then counted to quantify the expression of each gene. The counts are normalised to allow comparison between samples.
-   reads
-   quality control
-   align/pseudoalign
-   quantify
-   normalise


## What is a read

-   FASTQ format files
    -   sequences and information about each sequence's read accuracy



## Differential expression

-   what is differentially expressed
-   how are DE genes related
-   what are DE genes involved with

## Stem cells: background

Cells were sorted using flow cytometry on the basis of cell surface markers. There are three cell types:

-   long-term haematopoetic stem cells (LT-HSCs) 

-   haematopoetic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) 

-   progenitor cells (Progs) 

Each cell is then sequenced to quantify all the transcripts in each cell. different transcripts (genes) were identified.


## Stem cells: background

-   Raw data: [GEO Series GSE81682](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81682)
-   Illumina HiSeq
-   short reads 150-300bp
-   [A single-cell resolution map of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5305050/) [@nestorowa2016]
-   3,840 samples
-   Reads were aligned using G-SNAP and the mapped reads were assigned to Ensembl genes HTSeq
-   GSE81682_HTSeq_counts.txt.gz (bottom of the page). And [GSE81682_HTSeq_counts.txt.zip](../data/jillian/GSE81682_HTSeq_counts.zip)

##  Stem cells: Processing so far

-   selection of cells
-   selection of genes: subset of surfaceome
-   log2 normalised values

## Stem cells: Aims

-   Find interesting **cell surface molecule genes** that vary between cell types.


## Frog development: background

-   3 fertilisations = replicates
-   two siblings from each fertilisation one control, on FGF treated
-   sequenced at three time points: S14, S20, S30
-   3 x 2 x 3 = 18 groups

## Deliverables


1.  Describe the data
    -    Number of cells/samples/reps/treatments
    -    number of genes
    -    type of expression values
    -    prior processing
    -    missing values
    -    overview of expression 
    -    clustering of genes/samples

2.  Report on differential expression between two groups
    -   number of DE at 1%, 5% and 10%. 
    -   table of expression, fold changes, signifcance at each sig. 
    -   Volcano plot 

3.  Report list of marker candidate gene IDs for a cell type of choice. Justify filters. Table with fold FC, p values, IDs, canonical gene names

4.  Interpret the biology by reporting on a few group of genes and the processes in which they are involved.

5.  Report on your chosen genes and explain why you think they are good candidates for follow up work
