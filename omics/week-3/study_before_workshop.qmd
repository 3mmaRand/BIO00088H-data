## 🚧  NB still in construction 🚧



## Overview



::: incremental

-   Concise summary of the experimental design and aims

-   What the raw data consist of

-   What has been done to the data so far

-   What steps we will take in the workshop

:::

## The Data

There are three datasets

-   🐸 transcriptomic data (bulk RNA-seq) from frog embryos. 

-   🐭 transcriptomic data (single cell RNA-seq) from stemcells

-   🍂 ??????? Metabolomic / Metagenomic data from anaerobic digesters



# Experimental design

width="200"}

::: incremental
-   3 fertilisations

-   two siblings from each fertilisation one control, on FGF treated

-   sequenced at three time points

-   3 x 2 x 3 = 18 groups

## 🐸 Experimental design {auto-animate="true"}

![Schematic of frog development
experiment](images/88H-exp-design-betsy.png){fig-align="left"
width="200"}

::: incremental
-   3 fertilisations. [These are the replicates, `.5`, `.6`,
    `A`]{style="color:#009900"}

-   two siblings from each fertilisation one control, one FGF treated.
    [The treatments are paired]{style="color:#009900"}

-   sequenced at three time points. [S14, S20,
    S30]{style="color:#009900"}

-   3 x 2 x 3 = 18 groups
:::

## 🐸 Aim

::: incremental

-   find genes important in frog development

-   Important means genes that are differentially expressed between the control and the FGF treated sibling

-   Differentially expressed means the expression on one group is signifcantly higher than the other

:::


## 🐸 Guided analysis

::: incremental

-   The workshops will take you through comparing the control and FGF treated sibling at S30

-   This is the "least interesting" comparison

-   You will be guided to carefully document your work so you can apply the same methods to other comparisons

width="200"}

::: incremental
-   Cells were sorted using flow cytometry on the basis of cell surface
markers

-   There are three cell types: LT-HSCs, HSPCs, Progs 

-   Many cells of each cell type were sequenced

-

-   Many cells of each cell type were sequenced: [These are the replicates]{style="color:#009900"}

-   [155 LT-HSCs, 701 HSPCs, 798 Progs]{style="color:#009900"}

:::

## 🐭 Aim

::: incremental

-   find genes for cell surface proteins that are important in stem cell identity

-   Important means genes that are differentially expressed between at least two cell types

-   Differentially expressed means the expression on one group is significantly higher than the other

:::

::: incremental

-   The workshops will take you through comparing the HSPC and Prog cells

<!-- -   selection of cells -->
<!-- -   selection of genes: subset of surfaceome -->
<!-- -   log2 normalised values -->

<!-- ## Stem cells: Aims -->

<!-- -   Find interesting **cell surface molecule genes** that vary between -->
<!--     cell types. -->


<!-- the difference between HSPC and Prog cells the difference between the -->
<!-- control and the FGF treated sibling at S30 \## Sequence Data -->

<!-- -   The raw data are "reads" from a sequencing machine. Reads are short -->
<!--     sequences of DNA or RNA. -->

<!-- -   The reads are aligned to a reference genome or transcriptome. The -->
<!--     reads are then counted to quantify the expression of each gene. The -->
<!--     counts are normalised to allow comparison between samples. -->

<!-- -   reads -->

<!-- -   quality control -->

<!-- -   align/pseudoalign -->

<!-- -   quantify -->

<!-- -   normalise -->

<!-- ## What is a read -->

<!-- -   FASTQ format files -->
<!--     -   sequences and information about each sequence's read accuracy -->

<!-- ## Differential expression -->

<!-- -   what is differentially expressed -->
<!-- -   how are DE genes related -->
<!-- -   what are DE genes involved with -->

<!-- ## Stem cells: background -->
