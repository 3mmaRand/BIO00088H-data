# Independent study following the workshop

[Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

# The Code file

These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.

The [workshop.qmd](workshop.qmd) file is the file I use to compile the practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary text to be interleaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. Right-click on the link and choose Save-As to download. You will be able to open the Qmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/). Coding and thinking answers are marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

Pages made with R [@R-core], Quarto [@allaire2022], `knitr` [@knitr], `kableExtra` [@kableExtra]
