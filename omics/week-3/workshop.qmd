# Introduction


## Session overview

In this workshop you will 

See later workshops.

# Exercises

## Set up a Project

-   🎬 Start RStudio from the Start menu
-   🎬 Make an RStudio project. Be deliberate about where you create it so that it is a good place for you
-   🎬 Use the Files pane to make a new folder for the data. I suggest `data-raw`
-   🎬 Make a new script called `workshop-1.R` to carry out the rest of the work.
-   🎬 Record what you do and what you find out. All of it!
-   🎬 Load `tidyverse`


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Examine your data

The workshops will examine the "least interesting":
-   the difference between the control and the FGF treated sibling at S30
-   the difference between HSPC and Prog cells


🐸 Frog development data
-   [xlaevis_counts_S14.csv](data-raw/xlaevis_counts_S14.csv)
-   [xlaevis_counts_S20.csv](data-raw/xlaevis_counts_S20.csv)
-   [xlaevis_counts_S30.csv](data-raw/xlaevis_counts_S30.csv)
-   [meta_data.txt](data-raw/meta_data.txt)

🐭 Stem cell data
-   [surfaceome_hspc.csv](data-raw/surfaceome_hspc.csv)
-   [surfaceome_prog.csv](data-raw/surfaceome_prog.csv)
-   [surfaceome_lthsc.csv](data-raw/surfaceome_lthsc.csv)


-   🎬 Save the files to `data-raw` 
-   🎬 Open the data files in Excel
-   🎬 Describe what is in the rows and columns of each file. 
-   🎬 How many rows and columns are there in each file? Are these the same? In all cases or some cases? Why?
-   🎬 Google an id. Where does your search take you? How much information is available?
-   🎬 Did you record all that??

## Import
-   open in understanding the data numbers of variables, organisation

-   🎬 Import [xlaevis_counts_S30.csv](data-raw/xlaevis_counts_S30.csv), [surfaceome_hspc.csv](data-raw/surfaceome_hspc.csv) and  [surfaceome_prog.csv](data-raw/surfaceome_prog.csv)


```{r}
# 🐸 import the s30 data
s30 <- read_csv("data-raw/xlaevis_counts_S30.csv")
```


```{r}
# 🐭 import the hspc data
hspc <- read_csv("data-raw/surfaceome_hspc.csv")
```


```{r}
# 🐭 import the progs data
prog <- read_csv("data-raw/surfaceome_prog.csv")
```

-   🎬 Check these have the number of rows and column you were expecting and that column types and names are as expected.


## Explore

The 

Distributions

```{r}

```





-   what kind of values are they, how many missing
-   qc plots
-   removing the useless, writing to files


🐸 Frog development data
-   🎬 Make a script file called `cont-fgf-s30.R`. This will a be commented analysis of  the control vs FGF at S30 comparison. You will build on this each workshop and be able to use it as a template to examine other comparisons. Copy in the appropriate code and comments from `workshop-1.R`. Edit to improve your comments where your understanding has developed since you made them.

🐭 Stem cell data
-   🎬 Save the files to `data-raw` 




🎬 

You're finished!

# 🥳 Well Done! 🎉



# Independent study following the workshop

[Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

# The Code file

These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.

The [workshop.qmd](workshop.qmd) file is the file I use to compile the practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary text to be interleaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. Right-click on the link and choose Save-As to download. You will be able to open the Qmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/). Coding and thinking answers are marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`
