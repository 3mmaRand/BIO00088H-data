## Overview

In these slides we will:

::: incremental
-   Check where you are

-   learn some concepts 

    -   

-   Find out what packages to install before the workshop
:::

# Where should you be?

## Where should you be?

After the [Omics 2: üëã Statistical Analysis Workshop](../week-4/workshop.html)
including:

-   [ü§ó Look after future
    you!](../week-4/workshop.html#look-after-future-you) and

-   the [Independent Study to
    consolidate](../week-4/study_after_workshop.html), you should have:

## üê∏ Frogs

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   An RStudio Project called `frogs-88H` which contains:
    -   Raw data (S14, S20 and S30)
    -   Processed data (`s30_filtered.csv`, `s30_summary_gene.csv`,
        `s30_summary_gene_filtered.csv`, `s30_summary_samp.csv` and
        equivalents for S14 *OR* S20)
    -   Two scripts called `cont-fgf-s30.R` and `cont-fgf-s20.R` *OR*
        `cont-fgf-s14.R`
:::

Files should be organised into folders. Code should well commented and
easy to read.

## üê≠ Mice

-   An RStudio Project called `mice-88H` which contains
    -   Raw data (hspc, prog, lthsc)
    -   Processed data (`hspc_summary_gene.csv`,
        `hspc_summary_samp.csv`, `prog_summary_gene.csv`,
        `prog_summary_samp.csv`)
-   One script called `hspc-prog.R`

Files should be organised into folders. Code should well commented and
easy to read.

## üçÇ

Either of the other examples.

## If you do not have those

Go through:

-   [Omics 2: Statistical Analysis](../week-4/workshop.html)
    including:

-   [ü§ó Look after future
    you!](../week-4/workshop.html#look-after-future-you) and

-   the [Independent Study to
    consolidate](../week-4/study_after_workshop.html)

-   The üê≠ mouse data have been normalised to simplify the analysis for
    you; the üê∏ frog data have not but the DE method will do this for
    you.

## Packages to install before the workshop

**``** from CRAN in the the normal way:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("")
```

**`DESeq2`** from Bioconductor using BiocManager:
```{r}
#| eval: false
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```



# Workshops

## Workshops

-   Omics 1: Hello data Getting to know the data. Checking the
    distributions of values

-   Omics 2: Statistical Analysis Identifying which genes are
    differentially expressed between treatments.

-   Omics 3: Visualising and Interpreting. PCA, Volcano plots and heatmaps to visualise results. Interpreting the results and finding out more about genes of interest.
