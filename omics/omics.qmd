## Omics 1: Hello data!

This week you will meet your data. The independent study will concisely cover how these data were generated and how they have been processed before being given to you. There will also be an overview of the analysis we will carry out over three workshops.
In the workshop, you will learn what steps to take to get a good understanding of â€™omics data before you consider any statistical analysis. This is an often overlooked, but very valuable and informative, part of any data pipeline. It gives you the deep understanding of the data structures and values that you will need to code and trouble-shoot code, allows you to spot failed or problematic samples and informs your decisions on quality control.

before

-   which genes matter: expression, DE
-   goal of DE
-   how does DE work
-   multiple testing: FDR
-   say what comparisons we will do

workshop
-   open project import the data
-   revise!
-   prep for DE
-   lists of genes
-   writing to files

after

-   document what you have done
-   repeat on another comparison

## Omics 3: Visualising and Interpreting

before

workshop

-   open project import the data
