These are the steps we will take

1.  Find the genes that are expressed in only one treatment group.
2.  Create a DESeqDataSet object. This is a special object that is used
    by the **`DESeq2`** package
3.  Prepare the normalised counts from the DESeqDataSet object.
4.  Do differential expression analysis on the genes. This needs to be
    done on the raw counts.

All but the first step are done with the **`DESeq2`** package

### 1. Genes expressed in one treatment

The genes expressed in only one treatment group are those with zeros in
both replicates in one group and non-zero values in both 
replicates in the other group. For example, those shown here:

```{r}
#| echo: false
pro_meta_filtered  |>  
  filter(meta1 == 0) |> 
  filter(meta2 == 0) |>
  filter(meta3 == 0) |>
  head(5) |>
  knitr::kable()

```

We will use `filter()` to find these genes.

🎬 Find the genes that are expressed only in the procyclic-promastigote stage group:

```{r}
pro_meta_pro_only <- pro_meta_filtered  |>
  filter(pro1 > 0,
         pro2 > 0,
         pro3 > 0,
         meta1 == 0,
         meta2 == 0,
         meta2 == 0)
```

❓ How many genes are expressed only in the procyclic-promastigote stage group?

<!-- #---THINKING ANSWER--- -->

<!-- There are 19 genes expressed only in the procyclic-promastigote stage group. -->

🎬 Now you find any genes that are expressed only in the meta 
   stage group.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#---CODING ANSWER---
pro_meta_meta_only <- pro_meta_filtered  |>
  filter(pro1 == 0,
         pro2 == 0,
         pro3 == 0,
         meta1 > 0,
         meta2 > 0,
         meta2 > 0)

```

❓ How many genes are expressed only in the meta stage group?

<!-- #---THINKING ANSWER--- -->

<!-- There are 3 genes expressed only in the meta stage group. -->

❓ Do the results make sense to you in light of what you know about the
biology?

<!-- #---THINKING ANSWER--- -->

<!-- This is wildtype plant so perhaps normal processes do not happen  -->
<!-- when stage is meta and because the plant does not have 
<!-- adaptations for meta stage, no compensatory processes kick in. <!-- <!-- However, I'm not an expert in Arabidopsis, or plants! -->
<!-- Domain expertise is important when analysing data so  -->
<!-- discuss your results with Liz and your group. -->

🎬 Write all the genes that are expressed one group only to file 
(saved in `results`)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#---CODING ANSWER---
write_csv(pro_meta_pro_only, "results/pro_meta_pro_only.csv")
write_csv(pro_meta_meta_only, "results/pro_meta_meta_only.csv")
```

### 2. Create DESeqDataSet object

🎬 Load the DESeq2 package:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
#---CODING ANSWER---
library(DESeq2)
```



A DEseqDataSet object is a custom data type that is used by
**`DESeq2`**. Custom data types are common in the Bioconductor[^1]
packages. They are used to store data in a way that is useful for the
analysis. These data types typically have data, transformed data,
metadata and experimental designs within them.

[^1]: [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) is a project that
    develops and supports R packages for bioinformatics.

To create a DESeqDataSet object, we need to provide three things:

-  The raw counts - these are in `pro_meta_filtered `
-  The meta data which gives information about the samples and which
    treatment groups they belong to
-  A design matrix which captures the design of the statistical model.

The counts must in a *matrix* rather than a dataframe. Unlike a dataframe,
a matrix has columns of all the same type. That is, it will contain only
the counts. The gene ids are given as row names rather than a column.
The `matrix()` function will create a matrix from a dataframe of columns
of the same type and the `select()` function can be used to remove the
gene ids column.

🎬 Create a matrix of the counts:

```{r}
pro_meta_count_mat <- pro_meta_filtered  |>
  select(-gene_id) |>
  as.matrix()
```

🎬 Add the gene ids as row names to the matrix:

```{r}
# add the row names to the matrix
rownames(pro_meta_count_mat) <- pro_meta_filtered $gene_id

```

You might want to view the matrix (click on it in your environment pane).

The metadata are in a file,
[arab_meta_data.txt](meta/arab_meta_data.txt). This is a
tab-delimited file. The first column is the sample name and the other 
columns give the "treatments". In this case, the treatments genotype (with
two levels) and stage (with two levels).

🎬 Make a folder called `meta` and save the file to it.

🎬 Read the metadata into a dataframe:

```{r}
meta <- read_table("meta/arab_meta_data.txt")
```

🎬 Examine the resulting dataframe.

We need to add the sample names as row names to the metadata dataframe.
This is because the DESeqDataSet object will use the row names to match
the samples in the metadata to the samples in the counts matrix.

🎬 Add the sample names as row names to the metadata dataframe:

```{r}
row.names(meta) <- meta$sample_id
```

(you will get a warning message but you can ignore it)

We are dealing only with the wild data so we need to remove the samples
that are not in the wild data.

🎬 Filter the metadata to keep only the wild information:

```{r}
meta_wild <- meta |>
  filter(genotype == "wt")
```


We can now create the DESeqDataSet object. The design formula describes
the statistical model. You should recognise the form from previous work. 
The `~` can be read as "explain by" and on its right hand side are 
the explanatory variables. That is, the model is counts explained by
stage status.

Note that:

-   The names of the columns in the count matrix have to exactly match 
    the names of the rows in the metadata dataframe. They also need 
    to be in the same order.
-   The names of the explanatory variables in the design formula have 
    to match the names of columns in the metadata.

🎬 Create the DESeqDataSet object:

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(pro_meta_count_mat,
                              colData = meta_wild,
                              design = ~ stage)
```

The warning "Warning: some variables in design formula are characters,
converting to factors" just means that the variable type of stage in the metadata dataframe is "char" and it has been
converted into a factor type.

To help you understand what the `DESeqDataSet` object we have called 
`dds` contains, we can look its contents

The counts are in `dds@assays@data@listData[["counts"]]` and the
metadata are in `dds@colData` but the easiest way to see them is to use
the `counts()` and `colData()` functions from the **`DESeq2`** package.

🎬 View the counts:

```{r}
counts(dds) |> View()
```

You should be able to see that this is the same as in `pro_meta_count_mat`.

```{r}
colData(dds)

```

### 3. Prepare the normalised counts

The normalised counts are the counts that have been transformed to
account for the library size (i.e., the total number of reads in a
sample) and the gene length. We have to first estimate the normalisation
factors and store them in the DESeqDataSet object and then we can get
the normalised counts.

🎬 Estimate the factors for normalisation and store them in the
DESeqDataSet object:

```{r}
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
```

🎬 Look at the factors (just for information):

```{r}
sizeFactors(dds)
```

The normalised counts will be useful to use later. To get the normalised 
counts we again used the `counts()` function but this time we use the 
`normalized=TRUE` argument.

🎬 Save the normalised to a matrix:

```{r}
normalised_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
```


🎬 Make a dataframe of the normalised counts, adding a column for the gene
ids at the same time:

```{r}
pro_meta_normalised_counts <- data.frame(normalised_counts,
                                    gene_id = row.names(normalised_counts))

```

### 4. Differential expression analysis

We use the `DESeq()` function to do the differential expression
analysis. This function fits the statistical model to the data and then
uses the model to calculate the significance of the difference between
the treatments. It again stores the results in the DESseqDataSet object.
Note that the differential expression needs the raw (unnormalised
counts) as it does its own normalisation as part of the process.

🎬 Run the differential expression analysis and store the results in 
   the same object:

```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

The function will take only a few moments to run on this data but can
take longer for bigger datasets.

We need to define the contrasts we want to test. We want to test the
difference between the treatments so we will define the contrast as
`pro` and `meta`.

🎬 Define the contrast:

```{r}
contrast_suf <- c("stage", "pro", "meta")
```

Note that `stage` is the name of the column in the metadata
dataframe and `pro` and `meta` are the names of the levels in the
`stage` column. By putting them in the order `pro` , `meta` we
are saying the fold change will be pro / meta.  This means:

-   positive log fold changes indicate pro \> meta and
-   negative log fold changes indicates meta \> pro.

If we had put them in the order `meta`, `pro` we would have 
the reverse.

🎬 Extract the results from the DESseqDataSet object:

```{r}
results_pro <- results(dds,
                       contrast = contrast_pro)
```

This will give us the log~2~ fold change, the  *p*-value and the 
adjusted  *p*-value for the comparison between the pro- and  
meta-stage for each gene.

🎬 Put the results in a dataframe and add the gene ids as a column:

```{r}
pro_meta_results <- data.frame(results_pro,
                          gene_id = row.names(results_pro))
```

It is useful to have the normalised counts and the statistical results in 
one dataframe. 

🎬 Merge the two dataframes:
```{r}
# merge the results with the normalised counts
pro_meta_results <- pro_meta_normalised_counts |>
  left_join(pro_meta_results, by = "gene_id")
```

Now go to [Add gene information](#arabidopisis-4).


# Add gene information

## 💉 *Leishmania* 

[Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) [@martin2023;
@birney2004]is a bioinformatics project to organise all the biological
information around the sequences of large genomes. The are a large
number of databases but [BioMart](https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html)
[@smedley2009] provides a consistent interface to the material. There
are web-based tools to use these but the R package **`biomaRt`**
[@biomaRt1; @biomaRt2] gives you programmatic access making it easier to 
integrate information into R dataframes

🎬 Load the **`biomaRt`** [@biomaRt1; @biomaRt2] package:

```{r}
library(biomaRt)
```
The **`biomaRt`** package includes a function to list all the available
datasets

🎬 List the Ensembl "marts" available:
```{r}
listEnsemblGenomes()
```

`plants_mart` looks like the one we want. We can see what genomes are
available with names like "Arabidopsis" in this mart using the `searchDatasets()` function.

🎬  
```{r}
searchDatasets(useEnsemblGenomes(biomart = "plants_mart"), 
               pattern = "Arabidopsis")
```
`athaliana_eg_gene` is the Arabidopsis thaliana genes (TAIR10)	 dataset we want.

🎬 Connect to the `athaliana_eg_gene` database in `plants_mart`:
```{r}
ensembl <- useEnsemblGenomes(biomart = "plants_mart",
                             dataset = "athaliana_eg_gene")
```

🎬 See the the types of information we can retrieve:
```{r}                             
listAttributes(mart = ensembl) |> View()
```

There are many (1,714!) possible bits of information (attributes) that 
can be obtained. 

We use the `getBM()` function to retrieve information from the database. 
The `filters` argument is used to specified what kind of identifier 
we are supplying in `values` to retrieve information. The `attributes` 
argument is used to select the information we want to retrieve. 
The `values` argument is used to specify the identifiers. 
The mart argument is used to specify the connection we created.

🎬 Get the the gene name and a description. We also retreive the gene id 
   so we can later join the information with the results:

```{r}
gene_info <- getBM(filters = "ensembl_gene_id",
                   attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id",
                                  "external_gene_name",
                                  "description"),
                   values = pro_meta_results$gene_id,
                   mart = ensembl)
```


You should view the resulting dataframe to see what information is
available. You can use `glimpse()` or `View()`.

🎬 Merge the gene information with the results:

```{r}
# join the gene info with the results
pro_meta_results <- pro_meta_results |>
  left_join(gene_info,
            by = join_by(gene_id == ensembl_gene_id))
```

🎬 Save the results to a file:

```{r}
write_csv(pro_meta_results, file = "results/pro_meta_results.csv")
```

```
