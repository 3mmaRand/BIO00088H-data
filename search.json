It is telling us that there are functions in the dplyr package that have the same name as functions in the stats package and that R will use the dplyr version. As this is what you want, this has always been fine. It still is fine in this case. However, as you start to load more packages, you will want to know if you are using a function from a package that has the same name as a function in another loaded package. This is where the conflicted (Wickham 2023) package comes in. Conflicted will warn you when you are using a function that has the same name as a function in another package. You can then choose which function to use.\n🎬 Load the conflicted package:\n\nlibrary(conflicted)\n\nInstead of getting a warning every time you are using a function that has a function with the same name in another package, we can declare a preference for one function over another. This is useful for the functions you use a lot or ones where you are certain you always want to use a particular function.\nFor example, to always use the dplyr version of filter() by default you can add this to the top of your script:\n\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)\n\nWe will also want to ensure that we are using the setdiff() function from the GenomicRanges package which is used by DESeq2.\n\nconflicts_prefer(GenomicRanges::setdiff)",

This needs to be done on the raw counts.\n\nAll but the first step are done with the DESeq2 package\n1. Genes expressed in one treatment\nThe genes expressed in only one treatment group are those with zeros in all replicates in one group and non-zero values in all replicates in the other group. For example, those shown here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngene_id\ngene_name\nCTR1\nCTR2\nCTR3\nCTR4\nCTR5\nCTR6\nLWR1\nLWR2\nLWR3\nLWR4\nLWR5\nLWR6\n\n\n\nAT1G63820\nAT1G63820\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n13\n4\n4\n7\n10\n9\n\n\nAT1G27090\nAT1G27090\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n16\n6\n6\n9\n13\n14\n\n\nAT1G14950\nAT1G14950\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n14\n7\n4\n9\n13\n17\n\n\nAT1G18350\nMKK7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6\n8\n4\n4\n6\n8\n\n\nAT1G65910\nNAC028\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n15\n11\n5\n1\n3\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use filter() to find these genes.\n🎬 Find the genes that are expressed only in the control group:\n\nroot_lowni_only &lt;- root_filtered |&gt;\n  filter(if_all(starts_with(\"CTR\"), \\(x) x == 0),\n         if_all(starts_with(\"LWR\"), \\(x) x &gt; 0) )\n\nThis code creates a new data frame called root_lowni_only that contains only the rows from root_filtered where:\n\nAll CTR columns have a value of 0\nAll LWR columns have a value greater than 0\n\nfilter() keeps rows that match the conditions you give it. Here we give two conditions:\n\nAll columns whose names start with “CTR” must have a value of 0.\nAll columns whose names start with “LWR” must have a value greater than 0.\n\nThe if_all() function applies a test to each selected column (those starting with “CTR” or “LWR”) for each row. It returns TRUE only if all the selected columns pass the test.\nThe bit \\(x) x == 0 is an anonymous function — a function without a name. In base R syntax, it’s equivalent to: function(x) x == 0 Here, x will be the values from one column at a time, and the function checks whether they are equal to 0. We use an anonymous function because the condition needs to be applied separately to each column, but it’s simple enough that there’s no need to define a full named function elsewhere in the script.\n❓ How many genes are expressed only in the low nickel group?\n\n\nNote: There may have been more genes with counts in the low nickel group that were removed when we filtered on the total number of counts being less that 50.\n🎬 Now you find any genes that are expressed only in the control group.\n❓ How many genes are expressed only in the control group?\n\n\n❓ Do the results make sense to you in light of what you know about the biology?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎬 Write all the genes that are expressed one group only to file (saved in results)\n2. Create DESeqDataSet object\n🎬 Load the DESeq2 package:\nA DEseqDataSet object is a custom data type that is used by DESeq2. Custom data types are common in the Bioconductor1 packages. They are used to store data in a way that is useful for the analysis. These data types typically have data, transformed data, metadata and experimental designs within them.\nTo create a DESeqDataSet object, we need to provide three things:\n\nThe raw counts - these are in root_filtered\n\nThe meta data which gives information about the samples and which treatment groups they belong to\nA design matrix which captures the design of the statistical model.\n\nThe counts must in a matrix rather than a dataframe. Unlike a dataframe, a matrix has columns of all the same type. That is, it will contain only the counts. The gene ids are given as row names rather than a column. The matrix() function will create a matrix from a dataframe of columns of the same type and the select() function can be used to remove the gene ids column.\n🎬 Create a matrix of the counts:\n\nroot_count_mat &lt;- root_filtered |&gt;\n  select(-gene_id, -gene_name) |&gt;\n  as.matrix()\n\n🎬 Add the gene ids as row names to the matrix:\n\n# add the row names to the matrix\nrownames(root_count_mat) &lt;- root_filtered$gene_id\n\nYou might want to view the matrix (click on it in your environment pane).\nThe metadata are in a file, arab_meta_data.txt. This is a tab-delimited file. The first column is the sample name and the other columns give the “treatments”. In this case, the treatments are tissue (with two levels) and nickel (with two levels).\n🎬 Make a folder called meta and save the file to it.\n🎬 Read the metadata into a dataframe:\n\nmeta &lt;- read_table(\"meta/arab_meta_data.txt\")\n\n🎬 Examine the resulting dataframe.\nWe need to add the sample names as row names to the metadata dataframe. This is because the DESeqDataSet object will use the row names to match the samples in the metadata to the samples in the counts matrix.\n🎬 Add the sample names as row names to the metadata dataframe:\n\nmeta &lt;- meta |&gt;\n  column_to_rownames(\"sample_id\")\n\nWe are dealing only with the root data so we need to remove the samples that are not in the root data.\n🎬 Filter the metadata to keep only the root information:\n\nmeta_root &lt;- meta |&gt;\n  filter(tissue == \"root\")\n\nWe can now create the DESeqDataSet object. The design formula describes the statistical model. You should recognise the form from previous work. The ~ can be read as “explain by” and on its right hand side are the explanatory variables. That is, the model is counts explained by nickel status.\nNote that:\n\nThe names of the columns in the count matrix have to exactly match the names of the rows in the metadata dataframe. They also need to be in the same order.\nThe names of the explanatory variables in the design formula have to match the names of columns in the metadata.\n\n🎬 Create the DESeqDataSet object:\n\ndds &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(root_count_mat,\n                              colData = meta_root,\n                              design = ~ nickel)\n\nThe warning “Warning: some variables in design formula are characters, converting to factors” just means that the variable type of nickel in the metadata dataframe is “char” and it has been converted into a factor type.\nTo help you understand what the DESeqDataSet object we have called dds contains, we can look its contents\nThe counts are in dds@assays@data@listData[[\"counts\"]] and the metadata are in dds@colData but the easiest way to see them is to use the counts() and colData() functions from the DESeq2 package.\n🎬 View the counts:\n\ncounts(dds) |&gt; View()\n\nYou should be able to see that this is the same as in root_count_mat.\n🎬 View the column information:\n\ncolData(dds)\n\nDataFrame with 12 rows and 2 columns\n          tissue   nickel\n     &lt;character&gt; &lt;factor&gt;\nCTR1        root  control\nCTR2        root  control\nCTR3        root  control\nCTR4        root  control\nCTR5        root  control\n...          ...      ...\nLWR2        root   low_ni\nLWR3        root   low_ni\nLWR4        root   low_ni\nLWR5        root   low_ni\nLWR6        root   low_ni\n\n\nYou should be able to see this is the same as in meta_root.\n3. Prepare the normalised counts\nThe normalised counts are the counts that have been transformed to account for the library size (i.e., the total number of reads in a sample) and the gene length. We have to first estimate the normalisation factors and store them in the DESeqDataSet object and then we can get the normalised counts.\n🎬 Estimate the factors for normalisation and store them in the DESeqDataSet object:\n\ndds &lt;- estimateSizeFactors(dds)\n\n🎬 Look at the factors (just for information):\n\nsizeFactors(dds)\n\n     CTR1      CTR2      CTR3      CTR4      CTR5      CTR6      LWR1      LWR2 \n1.0241774 1.3312269 1.0264881 1.1672503 1.0274692 1.0104721 0.9390444 0.8343701 \n     LWR3      LWR4      LWR5      LWR6 \n0.8624386 0.9117912 1.0260560 0.9740408 \n\n\nThe normalised counts will be useful to use later. To get the normalised counts we again used the counts() function but this time we use the normalized=TRUE argument.\n🎬 Save the normalised to a matrix:\n\nnormalised_counts &lt;- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)\n\n🎬 Make a dataframe of the normalised counts, adding a column for the gene ids at the same time:\n\nroot_normalised_counts &lt;- data.frame(normalised_counts,\n                                    gene_id = row.names(normalised_counts))\n\n4. Differential expression analysis\nWe use the DESeq() function to do the differential expression analysis. This function fits the statistical model to the data and then uses the model to calculate the significance of the difference between the treatments. It again stores the results in the DESseqDataSet object. Note that the differential expression needs the raw (unnormalised counts) as it does its own normalisation as part of the process.\n🎬 Run the differential expression analysis and store the results in the same object:\n\ndds &lt;- DESeq(dds)\n\nThe function will take only a few moments to run on this data but can take longer for bigger datasets.\nWe need to define the contrasts we want to test. We want to test the difference between the treatments so we will define the contrast as control and low_ni.\n🎬 Define the contrast:\n\ncontrast_suf &lt;- c(\"nickel\", \"control\", \"low_ni\")\n\nNote that nickel is the name of the column in the metadata dataframe and control and low_ni are the names of the levels in the nickel column. By putting them in the order control , low_ni we are saying the fold change will be control / low_ni. This means:\n\npositive log fold changes indicate control &gt; low_ni and\nnegative log fold changes indicates low_ni &gt; control.\n\nIf we had put them in the order low_ni, control we would have the reverse.\n🎬 Extract the results from the DESseqDataSet object:\n\nresults_suf &lt;- results(dds,\n                       contrast = contrast_suf)\n\nThis will give us the log2 fold change, the p-value and the adjusted p-value for the comparison between the control and low_ni for each gene.\n🎬 Put the results in a dataframe and add the gene ids as a column:\n\nroot_results &lt;- data.frame(results_suf,\n                          gene_id = row.names(results_suf))\n\nIt is useful to have the normalised counts and the statistical results in one dataframe.\n🎬 Merge the two dataframes:\n\n# merge the results with the normalised counts\nroot_results &lt;- root_normalised_counts |&gt;\n  left_join(root_results, by = \"gene_id\")\n\nNow go to Add gene information.",

HSPC_001:HSPC_852 means all the columns from HSPC_001 to HSPC_852.\n🎬 Find the genes expressed only in progenitor cells (i.e., those that are 0 in every HSPC cell):\n\nhspc_prog |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  filter(sum(c_across(HSPC_001:HSPC_852)) == 0)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 1,500\n# Rowwise: \n# ℹ 1,500 variables: ensembl_gene_id &lt;chr&gt;, HSPC_001 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_002 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_003 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_004 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_006 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_008 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_009 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_011 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_012 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_014 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_015 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_016 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_017 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_018 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_020 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_021 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_022 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_023 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_024 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_025 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_026 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_027 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_028 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_030 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_031 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_033 &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nWe already know from last week’s work that there are no genes that are zero across all the cells (both types). If we did not know that, we would need to add |&gt; filter(sum(c_across(Prog_001:Prog_852)) != 0)\nmeaning zero in all the HSPC but not zero in all the Prog\n❓ How many genes are expressed only in the progenitor cells only\n\n\n🎬 Now you find any genes that are expressed only in the HSPC cells.\n❓ How many genes are expressed only in the HSPC cells?\n\n\n❓ Do the results make sense to you in light of what you know about the biology?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎬 Write all the genes that are expressed one cell type only to file (saved in results)\n2. Prepare the data for analysis with scran\n\nscran can use a matrix or a dataframe of counts but these must be log normalised counts. If using a dataframe, the columns must only contain the expression values (not the gene ids). The rows can be named to retain the gene ids.\nhspc_prog is a dataframe so we will use the ensembl gene ids to name the rows and remove the gene ids from the dataframe.\n🎬 Add the gene ids as the row names:\n\nhspc_prog &lt;- hspc_prog |&gt;\n  column_to_rownames(\"ensembl_gene_id\")\n\nLike DESeq2, scran needs metadata to define which columns were in which group. Instead of having this is a file, we will create a vector that indicates which column belongs to which cell type.\n🎬 Create a vector that indicates which column belongs to which cell type:\n\nn_hspc &lt;- 701\nn_prog &lt;- 798\n\ncell_type &lt;- rep(c(\"hspc\",\"prog\"), \n                 times = c(n_hspc, n_prog))\n\nThe number of times each cell type is repeated is the number of cells of that type. Do check that the length of the cell_type vector is the same as the number of columns in the hspc_prog dataframe.\n3. Differential expression analysis\n🎬 Load the scran package:\nDifferential expression is carried out with the findMarkers() function. It takes two arguments. The first argument is the dataframe containing the data and the second argument is the vector indicating which columns are in which cell type. Make sure that the order of the cell types in the vector is appropriate for the order of the columns in the dataframe.\n🎬 Run the differential expression analysis:\n\nresults_hspc_prog &lt;- findMarkers(hspc_prog, \n                             cell_type)\n\nThe output is a list object which, rather unnecessarily, includes two dataframes. This is not really necessary as the results are the same except for the fold change having a different sign.\n\n\nThe dataframe results_hspc_prog$prog is log prog - log hspc (i.e.,Prog/HSPC). This means:\n\nPositive fold change: prog is higher than hspc\nNegative fold change: hspc is higher than prog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results_hspc_prog$prog dataframe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop\np.value\nFDR\nsummary.logFC\nlogFC.hspc\nensembl_gene_id\n\n\n\nENSMUSG00000024399\n1\n0\n0\n-4.3900364\n-4.3900364\nENSMUSG00000024399\n\n\nENSMUSG00000079563\n2\n0\n0\n-4.0005511\n-4.0005511\nENSMUSG00000079563\n\n\nENSMUSG00000042817\n3\n0\n0\n-3.6990453\n-3.6990453\nENSMUSG00000042817\n\n\nENSMUSG00000063856\n4\n0\n0\n0.9115206\n0.9115206\nENSMUSG00000063856\n\n\nENSMUSG00000024053\n5\n0\n0\n3.0351647\n3.0351647\nENSMUSG00000024053\n\n\nENSMUSG00000069792\n6\n0\n0\n-3.4659544\n-3.4659544\nENSMUSG00000069792\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataframe results_hspc_prog$hspc is log hspc - log prog (i.e., HSPC/Prog).

It does not matter which one you use but you do need keep the direction of the foldchange in mind when interpreting the results.\nNotice that the dataframes are ordered by significance rather than the original gene order.\nIt is useful to have the normalised counts and the statistical results in one dataframe to which we will add the gene information from Ensembl. Having all the information together will make it easier to interpret the results and select genes of interest. We will need to extract the results from the list object, add the gene ids and then join with the normalised counts.\n🎬 Extract the results dataframe from the list object and add the gene ids as a column:\n\nhspc_prog_results &lt;- data.frame(results_hspc_prog$prog, \n                                ensembl_gene_id = row.names(results_hspc_prog$prog)) \n\n🎬 Return the ensembl gene ids as a column to the normalised counts:\n\nhspc_prog &lt;- hspc_prog |&gt;\n  rownames_to_column(var = \"ensembl_gene_id\")\n\n🎬 Merge the results dataframe with the normalised counts:\n\n# merge the results with the normalised counts\nhspc_prog_results &lt;- hspc_prog_results |&gt;\n  left_join(hspc_prog, by = \"ensembl_gene_id\")\n\nNow go to Add gene information.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have some data and information from Kelly. I have interpreted it and written some code to do the calculations.\nHowever, Kelly hasn’t had a chance to look at it yet so I am providing the exact information and data he supplied along with my suggested workflow based on my interpretation of the data and info.\n\nThe file is a CSV file, with some notes on top and the data in the following order, post notes and headers. Please note that all chemical data is in millimolar. There are 62 rows of actual data.\nSample Name – Replicate, Time (days), Acetate, Propanoate, Isobutyrate, Butyrate, Isopentanoate, Pentanoate, Isohexanoate, Hexanoate\nThe students should be able to transform the data from mM to mg/L, and to g/L. To do this they only need to multiply the molecular weight of the compound (listed in the notes in the file) by the concentration in mM to get mg/L. Obviously to get g/L they will just divide by 1000. They should be able to graph the VFA concentrations with time.\nThey should also be able to do a simple flux measurement, which is the change in VFA concentration over a period of time, divided by weight or volume of material. In this case it might be equal to == Delta(Acetate at 3 days - Acetate at 1 day)/Delta (3days - 1day)/50 mls sludge. This would provide a final flux with the units of mg acetate per ml sludge per day. Let me know if this isn’t clear.\nPerhaps more importantly they should be able to graph and extract the reaction rate, assuming a first order chemical/biological reaction and an exponential falloff rate. I found this as a starting point (https://martinlab.chem.umass.edu/r-fitting-data/) , but I assume Emma has something much more effective already in the pipeline.\n\nI created these two data files from the original.\n\n8 VFA in mM for 60 samples vfa.csv. There were 63 rows of data in the original file. There were no time 0 for one treatment and all values were zero for the other treatment so I removed those.\n\nTwo treatments: straw (CN10) and water (NC)\n10 time points: 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20, 22\nthree replicates per treatment per time point\n2 x 10 x 3 = 60 groups\n8 VFA with concentration in mM (millimolar): acetate, propanoate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isopentanoate, pentanoate, isohexanoate, hexanoate\n\n\nMolecular weights for each VFA in grams per mole mol_wt.txt VFAs from AD vials\n\nWe need to:\n\nCalculate Change in VFA g/l with time\nRecalculate the data into grams per litre - convert to molar: 1 millimolar to molar = 0.001 molar - multiply by the molecular weight of each VFA\nCalculate the percent representation of each VFA, by mM and by weight\nCalculate the flux (change in VFA concentration over a period of time, divided by weight or volume of material) of each VFA, by mM and by weight\nGraph and extract the reaction rate, assuming a first order chemical/biological reaction and an exponential falloff rate\n\n🎬 Start RStudio from the Start menu\n🎬 Make an RStudio project. Be deliberate about where you create it so that it is a good place for you\n🎬 Use the Files pane to make new folders for the data. I suggest data-raw and data-processed\n🎬 Make a new script called analysis.R to carry out the rest of the work.\n🎬 Load tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) for importing, summarising, plotting and filtering.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n🎬 Save the files to data-raw. Open them and examine them. You may want to use Excel for the csv file.\n🎬 Answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is in the rows and columns of each file?\nHow many rows and columns are there in each file?\nHow are the data organised ?\n\n🎬 Import\n\nvfa_cummul &lt;- read_csv(\"data-raw/vfa.csv\") |&gt; janitor::clean_names()\n\n🎬 Split treatment and replicate to separate columns so there is a treatment column:\n\nvfa_cummul &lt;- vfa_cummul |&gt; \n  separate(col = sample_replicate, \n           into = c(\"treatment\", \"replicate\"), \n           sep = \"-\",\n           remove = FALSE)\n\n📢 This code depends on the sample_replicate column being in the form treatment-replicate. In the sample data CN10 and NC are the treatments. The replicate is a number from 1 to 3. The value does include a encoding for time. You might want to edit your file to match this format.\nThe provided data is cumulative/absolute. We need to calculate the change in VFA with time. There is a function, lag() that will help us do this. It will take the previous value and subtract it from the current value. We need to do that separately for each sample_replicate so we need to group by sample_replicate first. We also need to make sure the data is in the right order so we will arrange by sample_replicate and time_day.\n\n🎬 Create dataframe for the change in VFA 📢 and the change in time\n\nvfa_delta &lt;- vfa_cummul |&gt; \n    group_by(sample_replicate)  |&gt; \n    arrange(sample_replicate, time_day) |&gt;\n    mutate(acetate = acetate - lag(acetate),\n           propanoate = propanoate - lag(propanoate),\n           isobutyrate = isobutyrate - lag(isobutyrate),\n           butyrate = butyrate - lag(butyrate),\n           isopentanoate = isopentanoate - lag(isopentanoate),\n           pentanoate = pentanoate - lag(pentanoate),\n           isohexanoate = isohexanoate - lag(isohexanoate),\n           hexanoate = hexanoate - lag(hexanoate),\n           delta_time = time_day - lag(time_day))\n\nNow we have two dataframes, one for the cumulative data and one for the change in VFA and time. Note that the VFA values have been replaced by the change in VFA but the change in time is in a separate column. I have done this because we later want to plot flux (not yet added) against time\n📢 This code also depends on the sample_replicate column being in the form treatment-replicate. lag is calculating the difference between a value at one time point and the next for a treatment-replicate combination.\n\nTo make conversions from mM to g/l we need to do mM * 0.001 * MW. We will import the molecular weight data, pivot the VFA data to long format and join the molecular weight data to the VFA data. Then we can calculate the g/l. We will do this for both the cumulative and delta dataframes.\n🎬 import molecular weight data\n\nmol_wt &lt;- read_table(\"data-raw/mol_wt.txt\") |&gt;\n  mutate(vfa = tolower(vfa))\n\n🎬 Pivot the cumulative data to long format:\n\nvfa_cummul &lt;- vfa_cummul |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = -c(sample_replicate,\n                         treatment, \n                         replicate,\n                         time_day),\n               values_to = \"conc_mM\",\n               names_to = \"vfa\") \n\nView vfa_cummul to check you understand what you have done.\n🎬 Join molecular weight to data and calculate g/l (mutate to convert to g/l * 0.001 * MW):\n\nvfa_cummul &lt;- vfa_cummul |&gt; \n  left_join(mol_wt, by = \"vfa\") |&gt;\n  mutate(conc_g_l = conc_mM * 0.001 * mw)\n\nView vfa_cummul to check you understand what you have done.\nRepeat for the delta data.\n🎬 Pivot the change data, delta_vfa to long format (📢 delta_time is added to the list of columns that do not need to be pivoted but repeated):\n\nvfa_delta &lt;- vfa_delta |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = -c(sample_replicate,\n                         treatment, \n                         replicate,\n                         time_day,\n                         delta_time),\n               values_to = \"conc_mM\",\n               names_to = \"vfa\") \n\nView vfa_delta to check it looks like vfa_cummul\n🎬 Join molecular weight to data and calculate g/l (mutate to convert to g/l * 0.001 * MW):\n\nvfa_delta &lt;- vfa_delta |&gt; \n  left_join(mol_wt, by = \"vfa\") |&gt;\n  mutate(conc_g_l = conc_mM * 0.001 * mw)\n\n\nby mM and by weight\n🎬 Add a column which is the percent representation of each VFA for mM and g/l:\n\nvfa_cummul &lt;- vfa_cummul |&gt; \n  group_by(sample_replicate, time_day) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent_conc_g_l = conc_g_l / sum(conc_g_l) * 100,\n         percent_conc_mM = conc_mM / sum(conc_mM) * 100)\n\n\n🎬 Make summary data for graphing\n\nvfa_cummul_summary &lt;- vfa_cummul |&gt; \n  group_by(treatment, time_day, vfa) |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_g_l = mean(conc_g_l),\n            se_g_l = sd(conc_g_l)/sqrt(length(conc_g_l)),\n            mean_mM = mean(conc_mM),\n            se_mM = sd(conc_mM)/sqrt(length(conc_mM))) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\nvfa_delta_summary &lt;- vfa_delta |&gt; \n  group_by(treatment, time_day, vfa) |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_g_l = mean(conc_g_l),\n            se_g_l = sd(conc_g_l)/sqrt(length(conc_g_l)),\n            mean_mM = mean(conc_mM),\n            se_mM = sd(conc_mM)/sqrt(length(conc_mM))) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n🎬 Graph the cumulative data, grams per litre:\n\nvfa_cummul_summary |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = time_day, colour = vfa)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = mean_g_l), \n            linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_g_l - se_g_l,\n                    ymax = mean_g_l + se_g_l),\n                width = 0.5, \n                show.legend = F,\n                linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(name = NULL) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Time (days)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Mean VFA concentration (g/l)\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  facet_wrap(~treatment) +\n  theme(strip.background = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎬 Graph the change data, grams per litre:\n\nvfa_delta_summary |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = time_day, colour = vfa)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = mean_g_l), \n            linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_g_l - se_g_l,\n                    ymax = mean_g_l + se_g_l),\n                width = 0.5, \n                show.legend = F,\n                linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(name = NULL) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Time (days)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Mean change in VFA concentration (g/l)\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  facet_wrap(~treatment) +\n  theme(strip.background = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎬 Graph the mean percent representation of each VFA g/l.

PCA will allow us to plot our samples in the “VFA” space so we can see if treatments, time or replicate cluster.\nHowever, PCA expects a matrix with samples in rows and VFA, the variables, in columns. We will need to select the columns we need and pivot wider. Then convert to a matrix.\n🎬\n\nvfa_cummul_pca &lt;- vfa_cummul |&gt; \n  select(sample_replicate, \n         treatment, \n         replicate, \n         time_day, \n         vfa, \n         conc_g_l) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = vfa, \n              values_from = conc_g_l)\n\n\nmat &lt;- vfa_cummul_pca |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  select(-sample_replicate, \n         -treatment, \n         -replicate, \n         -time_day) |&gt; \n  as.matrix()\n\n🎬 Perform PCA on the matrix:\n\npca &lt;- mat |&gt;\n  prcomp(scale. = TRUE, \n         rank. = 4) \n\nThe scale. argument tells prcomp() to scale the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The rank. argument tells prcomp() to only calculate the first 4 principal components. This is useful for visualisation as we can only plot in 2 or 3 dimensions. We can see the results of the PCA by viewing the summary() of the pca object.\n\nsummary(pca)\n\nImportance of first k=4 (out of 8) components:\n                          PC1    PC2     PC3     PC4\nStandard deviation     2.4977 0.9026 0.77959 0.45567\nProportion of Variance 0.7798 0.1018 0.07597 0.02595\nCumulative Proportion  0.7798 0.8816 0.95760 0.98355\n\n\nThe Proportion of Variance tells us how much of the variance is explained by each component. We can see that the first component explains 0.7798 of the variance, the second 0.1018, and the third 0.07597. Together the first three components explain nearly 96% of the total variance in the data. Plotting PC1 against PC2 will capture about 78% of the variance which is likely much better than we would get plotting any two VFA against each other. To plot the PC1 against PC2 we will need to extract the PC1 and PC2 score from the pca object and add labels for the samples.\n🎬 Create a dataframe of the PC1 and PC2 scores which are in pca$x and add the sample information from vfa_cummul_pca:\n\npca_labelled &lt;- data.frame(pca$x,\n                           sample_replicate = vfa_cummul_pca$sample_replicate,\n                           treatment = vfa_cummul_pca$treatment,\n                           replicate = vfa_cummul_pca$replicate,\n                           time_day = vfa_cummul_pca$time_day) \n\nThe dataframe should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC1\nPC2\nPC3\nPC4\nsample_replicate\ntreatment\nreplicate\ntime_day\n\n\n\n-2.9592362\n0.6710553\n0.0068846\n-0.4453904\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n1\n\n\n-2.7153060\n0.7338367\n-0.2856872\n-0.2030110\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n1\n\n\n-2.7423102\n0.8246832\n-0.4964249\n-0.1434490\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n1\n\n\n-1.1909064\n-1.0360724\n1.1249513\n-0.7360599\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n3\n\n\n-1.3831563\n0.9572091\n-1.5561657\n0.0582755\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n3\n\n\n-1.1628940\n-0.0865412\n-0.6046780\n-0.1976743\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n3\n\n\n-0.2769661\n-0.2221055\n1.1579897\n-0.6079395\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n5\n\n\n0.3480962\n0.3612522\n0.5841649\n-0.0612366\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n5\n\n\n-0.7281116\n1.6179706\n-0.6430170\n0.0660727\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n5\n\n\n0.9333578\n-0.1339061\n1.0870945\n-0.4374103\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n9\n\n\n2.0277528\n0.6993342\n0.3850147\n0.0723540\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n9\n\n\n1.9931908\n0.5127260\n0.6605782\n0.1841974\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n9\n\n\n1.8365692\n-0.4189762\n0.7029015\n-0.3873133\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n11\n\n\n2.3313978\n0.3274834\n-0.0135608\n0.0264372\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n11\n\n\n1.5833035\n0.9263509\n-0.1909483\n0.1358320\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n11\n\n\n2.8498246\n0.3815854\n-0.4763500\n-0.0280281\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n13\n\n\n3.5652461\n-0.0836709\n-0.5948483\n-0.1612809\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n13\n\n\n4.1314944\n-1.2254642\n0.2699666\n-0.3152100\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n13\n\n\n3.7338024\n-0.6744610\n0.4344639\n-0.3736234\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n16\n\n\n3.6748427\n0.5202498\n-0.4333685\n-0.1607235\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n16\n\n\n3.9057053\n0.3599520\n-0.3049074\n0.0540037\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n16\n\n\n3.4561583\n-0.0996639\n0.4472090\n-0.0185889\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n18\n\n\n3.6354729\n0.3809673\n-0.0934957\n0.0018722\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n18\n\n\n2.9872250\n0.7890400\n-0.2361098\n-0.1628506\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n18\n\n\n3.3562231\n-0.2866224\n0.1331068\n-0.2056366\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n20\n\n\n3.2009943\n0.4795967\n-0.2092384\n-0.5962183\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n20\n\n\n3.9948127\n0.7772640\n-0.3181372\n0.1218382\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n20\n\n\n2.8874207\n0.4554681\n0.3106044\n-0.2220240\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n22\n\n\n3.6868864\n0.9681097\n-0.2174166\n-0.2246775\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n22\n\n\n4.8689622\n0.5218563\n-0.2906042\n0.3532981\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n22\n\n\n-3.8483418\n1.5205541\n-0.8809715\n-0.5306228\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n1\n\n\n-3.7653460\n1.5598499\n-1.0570798\n-0.4075397\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n1\n\n\n-3.8586309\n1.6044929\n-1.0936576\n-0.4292404\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n1\n\n\n-2.6934553\n-0.9198406\n0.7439841\n-0.9881115\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n3\n\n\n-2.5064076\n-1.0856761\n0.6334250\n-0.8999028\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n3\n\n\n-2.4097945\n-1.2731546\n1.1767665\n-0.8715948\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n3\n\n\n-3.0567309\n0.5804906\n-0.1391344\n-0.3701763\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n5\n\n\n-2.3511737\n-0.3692016\n0.7053757\n-0.3284113\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n5\n\n\n-2.6752311\n-0.0637855\n0.4692194\n-0.3841240\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n5\n\n\n-1.2335368\n-0.6717374\n0.2155285\n0.1060486\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n9\n\n\n-1.6550689\n0.1576557\n0.0687658\n0.2750388\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n9\n\n\n-0.8948103\n-0.8171884\n0.8062876\n0.5032756\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n9\n\n\n-1.2512737\n-0.4720993\n0.4071788\n0.4693106\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n11\n\n\n-1.8091407\n0.0552546\n0.0424090\n0.3918222\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n11\n\n\n-2.4225566\n0.4998948\n-0.1987773\n0.1959282\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n11\n\n\n-0.9193427\n-0.7741826\n0.0918984\n0.5089847\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n13\n\n\n-0.8800183\n-0.7850404\n0.0895146\n0.6050052\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n13\n\n\n-1.3075763\n-0.2525829\n-0.2993318\n0.5874269\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n13\n\n\n-0.9543813\n-0.3170305\n0.0885062\n0.7153071\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n16\n\n\n-0.4303679\n-0.9952374\n0.2038883\n0.8214647\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n16\n\n\n-0.9457300\n-0.7180646\n0.3081282\n0.6563748\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n16\n\n\n-1.3830063\n0.0614677\n-0.2805342\n0.5462137\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n18\n\n\n-0.7960522\n-0.5792768\n-0.0369684\n0.6621526\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n18\n\n\n-1.6822927\n0.1041656\n0.0634251\n0.4337240\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n18\n\n\n-1.3157478\n-0.0835664\n-0.1246253\n0.5599467\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n20\n\n\n-1.7425068\n0.3029227\n-0.0161466\n0.5134360\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n20\n\n\n-1.3970678\n-0.2923056\n0.4324586\n0.4765460\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n20\n\n\n-1.0777451\n-0.1232925\n0.2388682\n0.7585307\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n22\n\n\n0.4851039\n-4.1291445\n-4.0625050\n-0.4582436\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n22\n\n\n-1.0516226\n-0.7228479\n1.0641320\n0.4955951\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n🎬 Plot PC1 against PC2 and colour by time and shape by treatment:\n\npca_labelled |&gt;

You can “Show in a new window” to see it in a larger format. You can also zoom in and out and pan around the heatmap and download it as a png. You might feel the colour bars is not adding much to the plot. You can remove it by setting hide_colorbar = TRUE, in the heatmaply() function.\nOne of the NC replicates at time = 22 is very different from the other replicates. The CN10 treatments cluster together at high time points. CN10 samples are more similar to NC samples early on. Most of the VFAs behave similarly with highest values later in the experiment for CN10 but isohexanoate and hexanoate differ. The difference might be because isohexanoate is especially low in the NC replicates at time = 1 and hexanoate is especially high in the NC replicate 2 at time = 22\n\nCalculate the flux(change in VFA concentration over a period of time, divided by weight or volume of material) of each VFA, by mM and by weight. Emma’s note: I think the terms flux and reaction rate are used interchangeably\nI’ve requested clarification: for the flux measurements, do they need graphs of the rate of change wrt time? And is the sludge volume going to be a constant for all samples or something they measure and varies by vial?\nAnswer: The sludge volume is constant, at 30 mls within a 120ml vial. Some students will want to graph reaction rate with time, others will want to compare the measured GC-FID concentrations against the model output.\n📢 Kelly asked for “.. a simple flux measurement, which is the change in VFA concentration over a period of time, divided by weight or volume of material. In this case it might be equal to == Delta(Acetate at 3 days - Acetate at 1 day)/Delta (3days - 1day)/50 mls sludge. This would provide a final flux with the units of mg acetate per ml sludge per day.”\nNote: Kelly says mg/ml where earlier he used g/L. These are the same (but I called my column conc_g_l)\nWe need to use the vfa_delta data frame. It contains the change in VFA concentration and the change in time. We will add a column for the flux of each VFA in g/L/day. (mg/ml/day)\n\nsludge_volume &lt;- 30 # ml\nvfa_delta &lt;- vfa_delta |&gt; \n  mutate(flux = conc_g_l / delta_time / sludge_volume)\n\nNAs at time 1 are expected because there’s no time before that to calculate a changes\n\nGraph and extract the reaction rate assuming a first order chemical/biological reaction and an exponential falloff rate\nI’ve requested clarification: for the nonlinear least squares curve fitting, I assume x is time but I’m not clear what the Y variable is - concentration? or change in concentration? or rate of change of concentration?\nAnswer: The non-linear equation describes concentration change with time. Effectively the change in concentration is dependent upon the available concentration, in this example [Hex] represents the concentration of Hexanoic acid, while the T0 and T1 represent time steps.\n[Hex]T1 = [Hex]T0 - [Hex]T0 * k\nOr. the amount of Hexanoic acid remaining at T1 (let’s say one hour from the last data point) is equal to the starting concentration ([Hex]T0) minus the concentration dependent metabolism ([Hex]To * k).\n📢 We can now plot the observed fluxes (reaction rates) over time\nI’ve summarised the data to add error bars and means\n\nvfa_delta_summary &lt;- vfa_delta |&gt; \n  group_by(treatment, time_day, vfa) |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_flux = mean(flux),\n            se_flux = sd(flux)/sqrt(length(flux))) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\nggplot(data = vfa_delta, aes(x = time_day, colour = vfa)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = flux), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = vfa_delta_summary, \n                aes(ymin = mean_flux - se_flux, \n                    ymax = mean_flux + se_flux), \n                width = 1) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = vfa_delta_summary, \n                aes(ymin = mean_flux, \n                    ymax = mean_flux), \n                width = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(name = NULL) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Time (days)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"VFA Flux mg/ml/day\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  facet_wrap(~treatment) +\n  theme(strip.background = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe this is easier to read:\n\nggplot(data = vfa_delta, aes(x = time_day, colour = treatment)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = flux), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = vfa_delta_summary, \n                aes(ymin = mean_flux - se_flux, \n                    ymax = mean_flux + se_flux), \n                width = 1) +\n  geom_errorbar(data = vfa_delta_summary, \n                aes(ymin = mean_flux, \n                    ymax = mean_flux), \n                width = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(name = NULL, begin = 0.2, end = 0.7) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Time (days)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"VFA Flux mg/ml/day\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  facet_wrap(~ vfa, nrow = 2) +\n  theme(strip.background = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have not yet worked out the best way to plot the modelled reaction rate",

There are 62 rows of actual data.\nSample Name – Replicate, Time (days), Acetate, Propanoate, Isobutyrate, Butyrate, Isopentanoate, Pentanoate, Isohexanoate, Hexanoate\nThe students should be able to transform the data from mM to mg/L, and to g/L. To do this they only need to multiply the molecular weight of the compound (listed in the notes in the file) by the concentration in mM to get mg/L. Obviously to get g/L they will just divide by 1000. They should be able to graph the VFA concentrations with time.\nThey should also be able to do a simple flux measurement, which is the change in VFA concentration over a period of time, divided by weight or volume of material.

We can see the results of the PCA by viewing the summary() of the pca object.\n\nsummary(pca)\n\nImportance of first k=4 (out of 8) components:\n                          PC1    PC2     PC3     PC4\nStandard deviation     2.4977 0.9026 0.77959 0.45567\nProportion of Variance 0.7798 0.1018 0.07597 0.02595\nCumulative Proportion  0.7798 0.8816 0.95760 0.98355\n\n\nThe Proportion of Variance tells us how much of the variance is explained by each component. We can see that the first component explains 0.7798 of the variance, the second 0.1018, and the third 0.07597. Together the first three components explain nearly 96% of the total variance in the data. Plotting PC1 against PC2 will capture about 78% of the variance which is likely much better than we would get plotting any two VFA against each other. To plot the PC1 against PC2 we will need to extract the PC1 and PC2 score from the pca object and add labels for the samples.\n🎬 Create a dataframe of the PC1 and PC2 scores which are in pca$x and add the sample information from vfa_cummul_pca:\n\npca_labelled &lt;- data.frame(pca$x,\n                           sample_replicate = vfa_cummul_pca$sample_replicate,\n                           treatment = vfa_cummul_pca$treatment,\n                           replicate = vfa_cummul_pca$replicate,\n                           time_day = vfa_cummul_pca$time_day) \n\nThe dataframe should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC1\nPC2\nPC3\nPC4\nsample_replicate\ntreatment\nreplicate\ntime_day\n\n\n\n-2.9592362\n0.6710553\n0.0068846\n-0.4453904\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n1\n\n\n-2.7153060\n0.7338367\n-0.2856872\n-0.2030110\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n1\n\n\n-2.7423102\n0.8246832\n-0.4964249\n-0.1434490\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n1\n\n\n-1.1909064\n-1.0360724\n1.1249513\n-0.7360599\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n3\n\n\n-1.3831563\n0.9572091\n-1.5561657\n0.0582755\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n3\n\n\n-1.1628940\n-0.0865412\n-0.6046780\n-0.1976743\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n3\n\n\n-0.2769661\n-0.2221055\n1.1579897\n-0.6079395\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n5\n\n\n0.3480962\n0.3612522\n0.5841649\n-0.0612366\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n5\n\n\n-0.7281116\n1.6179706\n-0.6430170\n0.0660727\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n5\n\n\n0.9333578\n-0.1339061\n1.0870945\n-0.4374103\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n9\n\n\n2.0277528\n0.6993342\n0.3850147\n0.0723540\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n9\n\n\n1.9931908\n0.5127260\n0.6605782\n0.1841974\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n9\n\n\n1.8365692\n-0.4189762\n0.7029015\n-0.3873133\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n11\n\n\n2.3313978\n0.3274834\n-0.0135608\n0.0264372\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n11\n\n\n1.5833035\n0.9263509\n-0.1909483\n0.1358320\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n11\n\n\n2.8498246\n0.3815854\n-0.4763500\n-0.0280281\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n13\n\n\n3.5652461\n-0.0836709\n-0.5948483\n-0.1612809\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n13\n\n\n4.1314944\n-1.2254642\n0.2699666\n-0.3152100\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n13\n\n\n3.7338024\n-0.6744610\n0.4344639\n-0.3736234\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n16\n\n\n3.6748427\n0.5202498\n-0.4333685\n-0.1607235\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n16\n\n\n3.9057053\n0.3599520\n-0.3049074\n0.0540037\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n16\n\n\n3.4561583\n-0.0996639\n0.4472090\n-0.0185889\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n18\n\n\n3.6354729\n0.3809673\n-0.0934957\n0.0018722\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n18\n\n\n2.9872250\n0.7890400\n-0.2361098\n-0.1628506\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n18\n\n\n3.3562231\n-0.2866224\n0.1331068\n-0.2056366\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n20\n\n\n3.2009943\n0.4795967\n-0.2092384\n-0.5962183\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n20\n\n\n3.9948127\n0.7772640\n-0.3181372\n0.1218382\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n20\n\n\n2.8874207\n0.4554681\n0.3106044\n-0.2220240\nCN10-1\nCN10\n1\n22\n\n\n3.6868864\n0.9681097\n-0.2174166\n-0.2246775\nCN10-2\nCN10\n2\n22\n\n\n4.8689622\n0.5218563\n-0.2906042\n0.3532981\nCN10-3\nCN10\n3\n22\n\n\n-3.8483418\n1.5205541\n-0.8809715\n-0.5306228\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n1\n\n\n-3.7653460\n1.5598499\n-1.0570798\n-0.4075397\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n1\n\n\n-3.8586309\n1.6044929\n-1.0936576\n-0.4292404\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n1\n\n\n-2.6934553\n-0.9198406\n0.7439841\n-0.9881115\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n3\n\n\n-2.5064076\n-1.0856761\n0.6334250\n-0.8999028\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n3\n\n\n-2.4097945\n-1.2731546\n1.1767665\n-0.8715948\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n3\n\n\n-3.0567309\n0.5804906\n-0.1391344\n-0.3701763\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n5\n\n\n-2.3511737\n-0.3692016\n0.7053757\n-0.3284113\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n5\n\n\n-2.6752311\n-0.0637855\n0.4692194\n-0.3841240\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n5\n\n\n-1.2335368\n-0.6717374\n0.2155285\n0.1060486\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n9\n\n\n-1.6550689\n0.1576557\n0.0687658\n0.2750388\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n9\n\n\n-0.8948103\n-0.8171884\n0.8062876\n0.5032756\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n9\n\n\n-1.2512737\n-0.4720993\n0.4071788\n0.4693106\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n11\n\n\n-1.8091407\n0.0552546\n0.0424090\n0.3918222\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n11\n\n\n-2.4225566\n0.4998948\n-0.1987773\n0.1959282\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n11\n\n\n-0.9193427\n-0.7741826\n0.0918984\n0.5089847\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n13\n\n\n-0.8800183\n-0.7850404\n0.0895146\n0.6050052\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n13\n\n\n-1.3075763\n-0.2525829\n-0.2993318\n0.5874269\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n13\n\n\n-0.9543813\n-0.3170305\n0.0885062\n0.7153071\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n16\n\n\n-0.4303679\n-0.9952374\n0.2038883\n0.8214647\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n16\n\n\n-0.9457300\n-0.7180646\n0.3081282\n0.6563748\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n16\n\n\n-1.3830063\n0.0614677\n-0.2805342\n0.5462137\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n18\n\n\n-0.7960522\n-0.5792768\n-0.0369684\n0.6621526\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n18\n\n\n-1.6822927\n0.1041656\n0.0634251\n0.4337240\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n18\n\n\n-1.3157478\n-0.0835664\n-0.1246253\n0.5599467\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n20\n\n\n-1.7425068\n0.3029227\n-0.0161466\n0.5134360\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n20\n\n\n-1.3970678\n-0.2923056\n0.4324586\n0.4765460\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n20\n\n\n-1.0777451\n-0.1232925\n0.2388682\n0.7585307\nNC-1\nNC\n1\n22\n\n\n0.4851039\n-4.1291445\n-4.0625050\n-0.4582436\nNC-2\nNC\n2\n22\n\n\n-1.0516226\n-0.7228479\n1.0641320\n0.4955951\nNC-3\nNC\n3\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n🎬 Plot PC1 against PC2 and colour by time and shape by treatment:\n\npca_labelled |&gt;

You can “Show in a new window” to see it in a larger format. You can also zoom in and out and pan around the heatmap and download it as a png. You might feel the colour bars is not adding much to the plot. You can remove it by setting hide_colorbar = TRUE, in the heatmaply() function.\nOne of the NC replicates at time = 22 is very different from the other replicates. The CN10 treatments cluster together at high time points. CN10 samples are more similar to NC samples early on. Most of the VFAs behave similarly with highest values later in the experiment for CN10 but isohexanoate and hexanoate differ. The difference might be because isohexanoate is especially low in the NC replicates at time = 1 and hexanoate is especially high in the NC replicate 2 at time = 22",

Emma’s note: I think the terms flux and reaction rate are used interchangeably\nI’ve requested clarification: for the flux measurements, do they need graphs of the rate of change wrt time? And is the sludge volume going to be a constant for all samples or something they measure and varies by vial?\nAnswer: The sludge volume is constant, at 30 mls within a 120ml vial. Some students will want to graph reaction rate with time, others will want to compare the measured GC-FID concentrations against the model output.\n📢 Kelly asked for “.. a simple flux measurement, which is the change in VFA concentration over a period of time, divided by weight or volume of material. In this case it might be equal to == Delta(Acetate at 3 days - Acetate at 1 day)/Delta (3days - 1day)/50 mls sludge. This would provide a final flux with the units of mg acetate per ml sludge per day.”\nNote: Kelly says mg/ml where earlier he used g/L. These are the same (but I called my column conc_g_l)\nWe need to use the vfa_delta data frame. It contains the change in VFA concentration and the change in time. We will add a column for the flux of each VFA in g/L/day.

I changed these in the csv file but not on the google sheet until someone can confirm there really are mislabelled).\nI’m going to split these into the two data sets and work on them separately\n🎬 Split the data into the two sets.

To achieve this, we can make use of the fact that TRUE evaluates to 1 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Consequently, summing a column of TRUE/FALSE values will give you the number of TRUE values. For example, sum(CTR1 &gt; 0) gives the number of values above zero in the CTR1 column. If you wanted the number of zeros, you could use sum(CTR1 == 0).\n🎬 Find the number values above zero in all six columns:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  summarise(sum(CTR1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR3 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR4 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR5 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR6 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR3 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR4 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR5 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR6 &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  `sum(CTR1 &gt; 0)` `sum(CTR2 &gt; 0)` `sum(CTR3 &gt; 0)` `sum(CTR4 &gt; 0)`\n            &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1           23119           23378           22789           23153\n# ℹ 8 more variables: `sum(CTR5 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(CTR6 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;,\n#   `sum(LWR1 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(LWR2 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(LWR3 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;,\n#   `sum(LWR4 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(LWR5 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(LWR6 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nThere is a better way of doing this that saves you having to repeat so much code - very useful if you have a lot more than 6 columns! We can use pivot_longer() to put the data in tidy format and then use the group_by() and summarise() approach we have used extensively before.\n🎬 Find the number of zeros in all columns:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(-gene_id, -gene_name),\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   sample n_above_zero\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1 CTR1          23119\n 2 CTR2          23378\n 3 CTR3          22789\n 4 CTR4          23153\n 5 CTR5          22941\n 6 CTR6          22982\n 7 LWR1          23103\n 8 LWR2          23111\n 9 LWR3          22955\n10 LWR4          22852\n11 LWR5          23122\n12 LWR6          23034\n\n\nYou could expand this code to get get other useful summary information\n🎬 Summarise all the samples:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(-gene_id, -gene_name),\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(min = min(count),\n            lowerq = quantile(count, 0.25),\n            mean = mean(count),\n            median = median(count),\n            upperq = quantile(count, 0.75),\n            max = max(count),\n            n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 8\n   sample   min lowerq  mean median upperq    max n_above_zero\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n 1 CTR1       0      0  706.    100    609 133872        23119\n 2 CTR2       0      0  931.    131    811 256188        23378\n 3 CTR3       0      0  715.     94    609 137167        22789\n 4 CTR4       0      0  786.    114    686 121160        23153\n 5 CTR5       0      0  731.     97    623 168910        22941\n 6 CTR6       0      0  704.     95    608 134192        22982\n 7 LWR1       0      0  730.     81    606 183421        23103\n 8 LWR2       0      0  622.     77    524 139241        23111\n 9 LWR3       0      0  647.     78    538 121856        22955\n10 LWR4       0      0  662.     80    566 139044        22852\n11 LWR5       0      0  740.     93    645 161872        23122\n12 LWR6       0      0  743.     89    625 179613        23034\n\n\nThe mean count ranges from 704 to 931. CTR2 stands out a little - having a higher mean and maximum than the others. When we have a good number of replicates – 6 is good in these experiments – this is unlikely to be a problem. The potential effect of having an odd replicate when you have only two or three replicates, is reduced statistical power. Differences between genes with lower average expression and or more variable expression might be missed. Whether this matters depends on the biological question you are asking. In this case, it does not matter because a) we have 6 replicates and b) because the major differences in gene expression will be enough.\n🎬 Save the summary as a dataframe, root_summary_samp (using assignment).\nWe can also plot the distribution of counts across samples. We have many values (32833) so we are not limited to using geom_histogram(). geom_density() gives us a smooth distribution.\n🎬 Plot the log10 of the counts + 1 again but this time facet by the sample:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(-gene_id, -gene_name),\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(log10(count + 1))) +\n  geom_density() +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ sample, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key information to take from these plots is:\n\nthe peak at zero suggests quite a few counts of 1.\nwe would expect the distribution of counts in each sample to be roughly log normal so that the rise near the low end, even before the peak at zero, suggests that these lower counts might be anomalies.\n\nWe have found the distribution across samples to be similar to that over all. This is good because it means that the samples are fairly consistent with each other. We can now move on to the next step.\nDistribution of values across the genes\nThere are lots of genes in this dataset therefore we will take a slightly different approach. We would not want to use plot a distribution for each gene in the same way. Will pivot the data to tidy and then summarise the counts for each gene.\n🎬 Summarise the counts for each gene and save the result as root_summary_gene. Include the same columns as we had in the by sample summary (root_summary_samp) and an additional column, total for the total number of counts for each gene.\n🎬 View the root_summary_gene dataframe.\nNotice that we have:\n\na lot of genes with counts of zero in every sample\na lot of genes with zero counts in several of the samples\nsome very very low counts.\n\nGenes with very low counts should be filtered out because they are unreliable - or, at the least, uninformative. The goal of our downstream analysis will be to see if there is a significant difference in gene expression between the control and FGF-treated sibling. Since we have only three replicates in each group, having one or two unreliable, missing or zero values, makes such a determination impossible for a particular gene. We will use the total counts (total) and the number of samples with non-zero values (n_above_zero) in this dataframe to filter our genes later.\nAs we have a lot of genes, it is helpful to plot the mean counts with geom_pointrange() to get an overview of the distributions. We will again plot the log of the mean counts. We will also order the genes from lowest to highest mean count.\n🎬 Plot the logged mean counts for each gene in order of size using geom_pointrange():\n\nroot_summary_gene |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gene_id, mean), y = log10(mean))) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = log10(mean - sd), \n                      ymax = log10(mean + sd )),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note the warning is expected since we have zero means).\nYou can see we also have quite a few genes with means less than 1 (log below zero). Note that the variability between genes (average counts between 0 and 43348) is far greater than between samples (average counts from 70 to 296) which is exactly what we would expect to see.\nNow go to Filtering for QC.",

There is nothing special about the number 25, it is just that summaries of a larger number of columns are difficult to grasp.\n🎬 Get a quick overview of the 7 columns:\n\n# examine all the columns quickly\n# works well with smaller numbers of column\nsummary(pro_meta)\n\n   gene_id             lm_pro_1           lm_pro_2           lm_pro_3       \n Length:8677        Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:    77.0   1st Qu.:    53.0   1st Qu.:    59.0  \n Mode  :character   Median :   191.0   Median :   135.0   Median :   145.0  \n                    Mean   :   364.5   Mean   :   255.7   Mean   :   281.4  \n                    3rd Qu.:   332.0   3rd Qu.:   238.0   3rd Qu.:   256.0  \n                    Max.   :442477.0   Max.   :295423.0   Max.   :411663.0  \n   lm_meta_1          lm_meta_2          lm_meta_3       \n Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n 1st Qu.:    48.0   1st Qu.:    51.0   1st Qu.:    78.0  \n Median :   110.0   Median :   120.0   Median :   187.0  \n Mean   :   220.3   Mean   :   221.9   Mean   :   355.9  \n 3rd Qu.:   197.0   3rd Qu.:   215.0   3rd Qu.:   341.0  \n Max.   :244569.0   Max.   :205203.0   Max.   :498303.0  \n\n\nNotice that:\n\nthe minimum count is 0 and the maximums are very high in all the columns\nthe medians are quite a lot lower than the means so the data are skewed (hump to the left, tail to the right) and there must be quite a lot of zeros\n\nWe want to know how many zeros there are in each a column. To achieve this, we can make use of the fact that TRUE evaluates to 1 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Consequently, summing a column of TRUE/FALSE values will give you the number of TRUE values. For example, sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0) gives the number of values above zero in the lm_pro_1 column. If you wanted the number of zeros, you could use sum(lm_pro_1 == 0).\n🎬 Find the number values above zero in all six columns:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  summarise(sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_pro_2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_pro_3 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_3 &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  `sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0)` `sum(lm_pro_2 &gt; 0)` `sum(lm_pro_3 &gt; 0)`\n                &lt;int&gt;               &lt;int&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n1                8549                8522                8509\n# ℹ 3 more variables: `sum(lm_meta_1 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(lm_meta_2 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;,\n#   `sum(lm_meta_3 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nThere is a better way of doing this that saves you having to repeat so much code - very useful if you have a lot more than 6 columns! We can use pivot_longer() to put the data in tidy format and then use the group_by() and summarise() approach we have used extensively before.\n🎬 Find the number of zeros in all columns:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  sample    n_above_zero\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n1 lm_meta_1         8535\n2 lm_meta_2         8535\n3 lm_meta_3         8530\n4 lm_pro_1          8549\n5 lm_pro_2          8522\n6 lm_pro_3          8509\n\n\nYou could expand this code to get get other useful summary information\n🎬 Summarise all the samples:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(min = min(count),\n            lowerq = quantile(count, 0.25),\n            mean = mean(count),\n            median = median(count),\n            upperq = quantile(count, 0.75),\n            max = max(count),\n            n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  sample      min lowerq  mean median upperq    max n_above_zero\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 lm_meta_1     0     48  220.    110    197 244569         8535\n2 lm_meta_2     0     51  222.    120    215 205203         8535\n3 lm_meta_3     0     78  356.    187    341 498303         8530\n4 lm_pro_1      0     77  364.    191    332 442477         8549\n5 lm_pro_2      0     53  256.    135    238 295423         8522\n6 lm_pro_3      0     59  281.    145    256 411663         8509\n\n\nThe mean count ranges from 220 to 364. We do not appear to have any outlying (odd) replicates. The potential effect of an odd replicate is reduced statistical power. Major differences in gene expression will still be uncovered. Differences between genes with lower average expression and or more variable expression might be missed. Whether this matters depends on the biological question you are asking.\n🎬 Save the summary as a dataframe, pro_meta_summary_samp (using assignment).\nWe can also plot the distribution of counts across samples. We have many values (8677) so we are not limited to using geom_histogram(). geom_density() gives us a smooth distribution.\n🎬 Plot the log10 of the counts + 1 again but this time facet by the sample:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(log10(count + 1))) +\n  geom_density() +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ sample, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key information to take from these plots is:\n\nthe distributions are roughly similar\nthe peak at zero suggests quite a few counts of 1.\nwe would expect the distribution of counts in each sample to be roughly log normal so that the small rise near the low end, even before the peak at zero, suggests that these lower counts might be anomalies.\n\nWe have found the distribution across samples to be similar to that over all. This is good because it means that the samples are fairly consistent with each other. We can now move on to the next step.\nDistribution of values across the genes\nThere are lots of genes in this dataset therefore we will take a slightly different approach. We would not want to use plot a distribution for each gene in the same way. Will pivot the data to tidy and then summarise the counts for each gene.\n🎬 Summarise the counts for each gene and save the result as pro_meta_summary_gene. Include the same columns as we had in the by sample summary (pro_meta_summary_samp) and an additional column, total for the total number of counts for each gene.\n🎬 View the pro_meta_summary_gene dataframe.\nNotice that we have:\n\na lot of genes with counts of zero in every sample\na lot of genes with zero counts in several of the samples\nsome very very low counts.\n\nGenes with very low counts should be filtered out because they are unreliable - or, at the least, uninformative. The goal of our downstream analysis will be to see if there is a significant difference in gene expression between the stages. Since we have only three replicates in each group, having one or two unreliable, missing or zero values, makes such a determination impossible for a particular gene. We will use the total counts (total) and the number of samples with non-zero values (n_above_zero) in this dataframe to filter our genes later.\nAs we have a lot of genes, it is helpful to plot the mean counts with geom_pointrange() to get an overview of the distributions. We will again plot the log of the mean counts. We will also order the genes from lowest to highest mean count.\n🎬 Plot the logged mean counts for each gene in order of size using geom_pointrange():\n\npro_meta_summary_gene |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gene_id, mean), y = log10(mean))) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = log10(mean - sd), \n                      ymax = log10(mean + sd )),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note the warning is expected since we have zero means).\nYou can see we also have quite a few genes with means less than 1 (log below zero). Note that the variability between genes (average counts between 0 and 349606) is far greater than between samples (average counts from 220 to 364) which is exactly what we would expect to see.\nNow go to Filtering for QC.",

We will join them using ensembl_gene_id to match the rows. The column names differ so we don’t need to worry about renaming any of them.\n🎬 Combine the two datasets by ensembl_gene_id and save the result as hspc_prog.\n\n#  combine the two datasets\nhspc_prog &lt;- hspc |&gt;\n  left_join(prog, \n            by = \"ensembl_gene_id\")\n\n🎬 Check the dataframe has the number of rows and columns you were expecting and that column types and names are as expected.\nDistribution of values across all the data in the file\nThe values are spread over multiple columns so in order to plot the distribution as a whole, we will need to first use pivot_longer() to put the data in ‘tidy’ format (Wickham 2014) by stacking the columns. We could save a copy of the stacked data and then plot it, but here, I have just piped the stacked data straight into ggplot(). This helps me avoid cluttering my R environment with temporary objects.\n🎬 Pivot the counts (stack the columns) so all the counts are in a single column (expr) labelled in cell by the column it came from and pipe into ggplot() to create a histogram:\n\nhspc_prog |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -ensembl_gene_id,\n               names_to = \"cell\",\n               values_to = \"expr\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = expr)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very striking distribution. Is it what we are expecting? Notice we have a peak at zero indicating there are low values zeros. This inflation of low values suggests some are anomalous - they will have been derived from low counts which are likely false positives. As inaccurate measures, we will want to exclude expression values below (about) 1. We will revisit this after we have considered the distribution of expression across cells and genes.\nWhat about the bimodal appearance of the the ‘real’ values? If we had the whole transcriptome we would not expect to see such a pattern - we’d expect to see a roughly normal distribution3. However, this is a subset of the genome and the nature of the subsetting has had an influence here. These are a subset of cell surface proteins that show a significant difference between at least two of twelve cell subtypes. That is, all of these genes are either “high” or “low” leading to a bimodal distribution.\nUnlike the other three datasets, which count raw counts, these data are normalised and log2 transformed. We do not need to plot the log of the values to see the distribution - they are already logged.\nDistribution of values across the samples\nFor the other three datasets, we used the summary() function to get an overview of the columns. This works well when you have upto about 25 columns but it is not helpful here because we have a lot of cells! Feel free to try it!\nIn this data set, there is even more of an advantage of using the pivot_longer(), group_by() and summarise() approach. We will be able to open the dataframe in the Viewer and make plots to examine whether the distributions are similar across cells. The mean and the standard deviation are useful to see the distributions across cells in a plot but we will also examine the interquartile values, maximums and the number of non-zero values.\n🎬 Summarise all the cells:\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell &lt;- hspc_prog |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -ensembl_gene_id,\n               names_to = \"cell\",\n               values_to = \"expr\") |&gt;\n  group_by(cell) |&gt;\n  summarise(min = min(expr),\n            lowerq = quantile(expr, 0.25),\n            sd = sd(expr),\n            mean = mean(expr),\n            median = median(expr),\n            upperq = quantile(expr, 0.75),\n            max = max(expr),\n            total = sum(expr),\n            n_above_zero = sum(expr &gt; 0))\n\n🎬 View the hspc_prog_summary_cell dataframe (click on it in the environment).\nNotice that: - a minimum value of 0 appears in all 1499 cells - the lower quartiles are all zero and so are many of the medians - there are no cells with above 0 expression in all 423 of the gene subset - the highest number of genes expressed is 287, the lowest is 139\nIn short, there are quite a lot of zeros.\nTo get a better understanding of the distribution of expressions in cells we can create a ggplot using the pointrange geom. Pointrange puts a dot at the mean and a line between a minimum and a maximum such as +/- one standard deviation. Not unlike a boxplot, but when you need the boxes too be very narrow!\n🎬 Create a pointrange plot.\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = cell, y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd ),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to use the Zoom button to pop the plot window out so you can make it as wide as possible\nThe things to notice are:\n\nthe average expression in cells is similar for all cells. This is good to know - if some cells had much lower expression perhaps there is something wrong with them, or their sequencing, and they should be excluded.\nthe distributions are roughly similar in width too\n\nThe default order of cell is alphabetical. It can be easier to judge if there are unusual cells if we order the lines by the size of the mean.\n🎬 Order a pointrange plot with reorder(variable_to_order, order_by).\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(cell, mean), y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd ),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreorder() arranges cell in increasing size of mean\nAs we thought, the distributions are similar across cells - there are not any cells that are obviously different from the others (only incrementally).\nDistribution of values across the genes\nWe will use the same approach to summarise the genes.\n🎬 Summarise the expression for each gene and save the result as hspc_prog_summary_gene. Include the same columns as we had in the by cell summary (hspc_prog_summary_cell) and an additional column, total for the total expression for each gene.\n🎬 View the hspc_prog_summary_gene dataframe. Remember these are normalised and logged (base 2) so we should not see very large values.\nNotice that:\n\nsome genes are expressed in every cell, and many are expressed in most cells\nquite a few genes are zero in many cells. This this matters less when we have many cells (samples) than when we have few samples.\nno genes have zeros in every cell - the lowest number of cells is is 8\n\nIt is again helpful to plot the ordered mean expression with pointrange to get an overview.\n🎬 Plot the logged mean counts for each gene in order of size using geom_pointrange():\n\nhspc_prog_summary_gene |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(ensembl_gene_id, mean), y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the variability between genes (average expression between 0.020 and and 9.567) is far greater than between cells (average expression from 1.319 to 9.567) which is just what we would expect.\nNow go to Filtering for QC.",

We could save a copy of the stacked data and then plot it, but here, I have just piped the stacked data straight into ggplot(). This helps me avoid cluttering my R environment with temporary objects.\n🎬 Pivot the counts (stack the columns) so all the counts are in a single column (count) labelled in sample by the column it came from and pipe into ggplot() to create a histogram:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(-gene_id, -gene_name),\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = count)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data is very skewed - there are very many low counts and a very few higher numbers. It is hard to see the very low bars for the higher values. Logging the counts is a way to make the distribution more visible. You cannot take the log of 0 so we add 1 to the count before logging. The log of 1 is zero so we will be able to see how many zeros we had.\n🎬 Repeat the plot of log of the counts.\n\nroot |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(-gene_id, -gene_name),\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = log10(count + 1))) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve used base 10 only because it easy to convert to the original scale (1 is 10, 2 is 100, 3 is 1000 etc). Notice we have a peak at zero indicating there are many zeros. We would expect the distribution of counts to be roughly log normal because this is expression of all the genes in the genome1. The number of low counts is inflated (small peak near the low end). This suggests that these lower counts might be false positives. The removal of low counts is a common processing step in ’omic data. We will revisit this after we have considered the distribution of counts across samples and genes.\nDistribution of values across the samples\nSummary statistics including the the number of NAs can be seen using the summary(). It is most helpful which you have up to about 25 columns. There is nothing special about the number 25, it is just that summaries of a larger number of columns are difficult to grasp.\n🎬 Get a quick overview of the 14 columns:\n\n# examine all the columns quickly\n# works well with smaller numbers of column\nsummary(root)\n\n   gene_id           gene_name              CTR1               CTR2         \n Length:32833       Length:32833       Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:     0.0   1st Qu.:     0.0  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :   100.0   Median :   131.0  \n                                       Mean   :   705.9   Mean   :   930.5  \n                                       3rd Qu.:   609.0   3rd Qu.:   811.0  \n                                       Max.   :133872.0   Max.   :256188.0  \n      CTR3               CTR4               CTR5               CTR6         \n Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n 1st Qu.:     0.0   1st Qu.:     0.0   1st Qu.:     0.0   1st Qu.:     0.0  \n Median :    94.0   Median :   114.0   Median :    97.0   Median :    95.0  \n Mean   :   715.2   Mean   :   786.5   Mean   :   731.4   Mean   :   703.7  \n 3rd Qu.:   609.0   3rd Qu.:   686.0   3rd Qu.:   623.0   3rd Qu.:   608.0  \n Max.   :137167.0   Max.   :121160.0   Max.   :168910.0   Max.   :134192.0  \n      LWR1               LWR2               LWR3               LWR4         \n Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n 1st Qu.:     0.0   1st Qu.:     0.0   1st Qu.:     0.0   1st Qu.:     0.0  \n Median :    81.0   Median :    77.0   Median :    78.0   Median :    80.0  \n Mean   :   730.1   Mean   :   622.2   Mean   :   647.1   Mean   :   662.3  \n 3rd Qu.:   606.0   3rd Qu.:   524.0   3rd Qu.:   538.0   3rd Qu.:   566.0  \n Max.   :183421.0   Max.   :139241.0   Max.   :121856.0   Max.   :139044.0  \n      LWR5               LWR6         \n Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n 1st Qu.:     0.0   1st Qu.:     0.0  \n Median :    93.0   Median :    89.0  \n Mean   :   739.7   Mean   :   742.8  \n 3rd Qu.:   645.0   3rd Qu.:   625.0  \n Max.   :161872.0   Max.   :179613.0  \n\n\nNotice that:\n\nthe minimum count is 0 and the maximums are very high in all the columns\nthe medians are quite a lot lower than the means so the data are skewed (hump to the left, tail to the right) and there must be quite a lot of zeros\n\nWe want to know how many zeros there are in each a column. To achieve this, we can make use of the fact that TRUE evaluates to 1 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Consequently, summing a column of TRUE/FALSE values will give you the number of TRUE values. For example, sum(CTR1 &gt; 0) gives the number of values above zero in the CTR1 column. If you wanted the number of zeros, you could use sum(CTR1 == 0).\n🎬 Find the number values above zero in all six columns:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  summarise(sum(CTR1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR3 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR4 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR5 &gt; 0),\n            sum(CTR6 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR3 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR4 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR5 &gt; 0),\n            sum(LWR6 &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  `sum(CTR1 &gt; 0)` `sum(CTR2 &gt; 0)` `sum(CTR3 &gt; 0)` `sum(CTR4 &gt; 0)`\n            &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1           23119           23378           22789           23153\n# ℹ 8 more variables: `sum(CTR5 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(CTR6 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;,\n#   `sum(LWR1 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(LWR2 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(LWR3 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;,\n#   `sum(LWR4 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(LWR5 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(LWR6 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nThere is a better way of doing this that saves you having to repeat so much code - very useful if you have a lot more than 6 columns! We can use pivot_longer() to put the data in tidy format and then use the group_by() and summarise() approach we have used extensively before.\n🎬 Find the number of zeros in all columns:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(-gene_id, -gene_name),\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   sample n_above_zero\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1 CTR1          23119\n 2 CTR2          23378\n 3 CTR3          22789\n 4 CTR4          23153\n 5 CTR5          22941\n 6 CTR6          22982\n 7 LWR1          23103\n 8 LWR2          23111\n 9 LWR3          22955\n10 LWR4          22852\n11 LWR5          23122\n12 LWR6          23034\n\n\nYou could expand this code to get get other useful summary information\n🎬 Summarise all the samples:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(-gene_id, -gene_name),\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(min = min(count),\n            lowerq = quantile(count, 0.25),\n            mean = mean(count),\n            median = median(count),\n            upperq = quantile(count, 0.75),\n            max = max(count),\n            n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 8\n   sample   min lowerq  mean median upperq    max n_above_zero\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n 1 CTR1       0      0  706.    100    609 133872        23119\n 2 CTR2       0      0  931.    131    811 256188        23378\n 3 CTR3       0      0  715.     94    609 137167        22789\n 4 CTR4       0      0  786.    114    686 121160        23153\n 5 CTR5       0      0  731.     97    623 168910        22941\n 6 CTR6       0      0  704.     95    608 134192        22982\n 7 LWR1       0      0  730.     81    606 183421        23103\n 8 LWR2       0      0  622.     77    524 139241        23111\n 9 LWR3       0      0  647.     78    538 121856        22955\n10 LWR4       0      0  662.     80    566 139044        22852\n11 LWR5       0      0  740.     93    645 161872        23122\n12 LWR6       0      0  743.     89    625 179613        23034\n\n\nThe mean count ranges from 704 to 931. CTR2 stands out a little - having a higher mean and maximum than the others. When we have a good number of replicates – 6 is good in these experiments – this is unlikely to be a problem. The potential effect of having an odd replicate when you have only two or three replicates, is reduced statistical power. Differences between genes with lower average expression and or more variable expression might be missed. Whether this matters depends on the biological question you are asking. In this case, it does not matter because a) we have 6 replicates and b) because the major differences in gene expression will be enough.\n🎬 Save the summary as a dataframe, root_summary_samp (using assignment).\nWe can also plot the distribution of counts across samples. We have many values (32833) so we are not limited to using geom_histogram(). geom_density() gives us a smooth distribution.\n🎬 Plot the log10 of the counts + 1 again but this time facet by the sample:\n\nroot |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(-gene_id, -gene_name),\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(log10(count + 1))) +\n  geom_density() +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ sample, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key information to take from these plots is:\n\nthe peak at zero suggests quite a few counts of 1.\nwe would expect the distribution of counts in each sample to be roughly log normal so that the rise near the low end, even before the peak at zero, suggests that these lower counts might be anomalies.\n\nWe have found the distribution across samples to be similar to that over all. This is good because it means that the samples are fairly consistent with each other. We can now move on to the next step.\nDistribution of values across the genes\nThere are lots of genes in this dataset therefore we will take a slightly different approach. We would not want to use plot a distribution for each gene in the same way. Will pivot the data to tidy and then summarise the counts for each gene.\n🎬 Summarise the counts for each gene and save the result as root_summary_gene. Include the same columns as we had in the by sample summary (root_summary_samp) and an additional column, total for the total number of counts for each gene.\n🎬 View the root_summary_gene dataframe.\nNotice that we have:\n\na lot of genes with counts of zero in every sample\na lot of genes with zero counts in several of the samples\nsome very very low counts.\n\nGenes with very low counts should be filtered out because they are unreliable - or, at the least, uninformative. The goal of our downstream analysis will be to see if there is a significant difference in gene expression between the control and FGF-treated sibling. Since we have only three replicates in each group, having one or two unreliable, missing or zero values, makes such a determination impossible for a particular gene. We will use the total counts (total) and the number of samples with non-zero values (n_above_zero) in this dataframe to filter our genes later.\nAs we have a lot of genes, it is helpful to plot the mean counts with geom_pointrange() to get an overview of the distributions. We will again plot the log of the mean counts. We will also order the genes from lowest to highest mean count.\n🎬 Plot the logged mean counts for each gene in order of size using geom_pointrange():\n\nroot_summary_gene |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gene_id, mean), y = log10(mean))) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = log10(mean - sd), \n                      ymax = log10(mean + sd )),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note the warning is expected since we have zero means).\nYou can see we also have quite a few genes with means less than 1 (log below zero). Note that the variability between genes (average counts between 0 and 43348) is far greater than between samples (average counts from 70 to 296) which is exactly what we would expect to see.\nNow go to Filtering for QC."

We could save a copy of the stacked data and then plot it, but here, I have just piped the stacked data straight into ggplot(). This helps me avoid cluttering my R environment with temporary objects.\n🎬 Pivot the counts (stack the columns) so all the counts are in a single column (count) labelled in sample by the column it came from and pipe into ggplot() to create a histogram:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = count)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data is very skewed - there are very many low counts and a very few higher numbers. It is hard to see the very low bars for the higher values. Logging the counts is a way to make the distribution more visible. You cannot take the log of 0 so we add 1 to the count before logging. The log of 1 is zero so we will be able to see how many zeros we had.\n🎬 Repeat the plot of log of the counts.\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = log10(count + 1))) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve used base 10 only because it easy to convert to the original scale (1 is 10, 2 is 100, 3 is 1000 etc). Notice we have a peak at zero indicating there are many zeros. We would expect the distribution of counts to be roughly log normal because this is expression of all the genes in the genome2. The number of low counts is inflated (small peak near the low end). This suggests that these lower counts might be false positives. The removal of low counts is a common processing step in ’omic data. We will revisit this after we have considered the distribution of counts across samples and genes.\nDistribution of values across the samples\nSummary statistics including the the number of NAs can be seen using the summary(). It is most helpful which you have up to about 25 columns. There is nothing special about the number 25, it is just that summaries of a larger number of columns are difficult to grasp.\n🎬 Get a quick overview of the 7 columns:\n\n# examine all the columns quickly\n# works well with smaller numbers of column\nsummary(pro_meta)\n\n   gene_id             lm_pro_1           lm_pro_2           lm_pro_3       \n Length:8677        Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:    77.0   1st Qu.:    53.0   1st Qu.:    59.0  \n Mode  :character   Median :   191.0   Median :   135.0   Median :   145.0  \n                    Mean   :   364.5   Mean   :   255.7   Mean   :   281.4  \n                    3rd Qu.:   332.0   3rd Qu.:   238.0   3rd Qu.:   256.0  \n                    Max.   :442477.0   Max.   :295423.0   Max.   :411663.0  \n   lm_meta_1          lm_meta_2          lm_meta_3       \n Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n 1st Qu.:    48.0   1st Qu.:    51.0   1st Qu.:    78.0  \n Median :   110.0   Median :   120.0   Median :   187.0  \n Mean   :   220.3   Mean   :   221.9   Mean   :   355.9  \n 3rd Qu.:   197.0   3rd Qu.:   215.0   3rd Qu.:   341.0  \n Max.   :244569.0   Max.   :205203.0   Max.   :498303.0  \n\n\nNotice that:\n\nthe minimum count is 0 and the maximums are very high in all the columns\nthe medians are quite a lot lower than the means so the data are skewed (hump to the left, tail to the right) and there must be quite a lot of zeros\n\nWe want to know how many zeros there are in each a column. To achieve this, we can make use of the fact that TRUE evaluates to 1 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Consequently, summing a column of TRUE/FALSE values will give you the number of TRUE values. For example, sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0) gives the number of values above zero in the lm_pro_1 column. If you wanted the number of zeros, you could use sum(lm_pro_1 == 0).\n🎬 Find the number values above zero in all six columns:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  summarise(sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_pro_2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_pro_3 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_3 &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  `sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0)` `sum(lm_pro_2 &gt; 0)` `sum(lm_pro_3 &gt; 0)`\n                &lt;int&gt;               &lt;int&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n1                8549                8522                8509\n# ℹ 3 more variables: `sum(lm_meta_1 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(lm_meta_2 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;,\n#   `sum(lm_meta_3 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nThere is a better way of doing this that saves you having to repeat so much code - very useful if you have a lot more than 6 columns! We can use pivot_longer() to put the data in tidy format and then use the group_by() and summarise() approach we have used extensively before.\n🎬 Find the number of zeros in all columns:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  sample    n_above_zero\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n1 lm_meta_1         8535\n2 lm_meta_2         8535\n3 lm_meta_3         8530\n4 lm_pro_1          8549\n5 lm_pro_2          8522\n6 lm_pro_3          8509\n\n\nYou could expand this code to get get other useful summary information\n🎬 Summarise all the samples:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(min = min(count),\n            lowerq = quantile(count, 0.25),\n            mean = mean(count),\n            median = median(count),\n            upperq = quantile(count, 0.75),\n            max = max(count),\n            n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  sample      min lowerq  mean median upperq    max n_above_zero\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 lm_meta_1     0     48  220.    110    197 244569         8535\n2 lm_meta_2     0     51  222.    120    215 205203         8535\n3 lm_meta_3     0     78  356.    187    341 498303         8530\n4 lm_pro_1      0     77  364.    191    332 442477         8549\n5 lm_pro_2      0     53  256.    135    238 295423         8522\n6 lm_pro_3      0     59  281.    145    256 411663         8509\n\n\nThe mean count ranges from 220 to 364. We do not appear to have any outlying (odd) replicates. The potential effect of an odd replicate is reduced statistical power. Major differences in gene expression will still be uncovered. Differences between genes with lower average expression and or more variable expression might be missed. Whether this matters depends on the biological question you are asking.\n🎬 Save the summary as a dataframe, pro_meta_summary_samp (using assignment).\nWe can also plot the distribution of counts across samples. We have many values (8677) so we are not limited to using geom_histogram(). geom_density() gives us a smooth distribution.\n🎬 Plot the log10 of the counts + 1 again but this time facet by the sample:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(log10(count + 1))) +\n  geom_density() +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ sample, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key information to take from these plots is:\n\nthe distributions are roughly similar\nthe peak at zero suggests quite a few counts of 1.\nwe would expect the distribution of counts in each sample to be roughly log normal so that the small rise near the low end, even before the peak at zero, suggests that these lower counts might be anomalies.\n\nWe have found the distribution across samples to be similar to that over all. This is good because it means that the samples are fairly consistent with each other. We can now move on to the next step.\nDistribution of values across the genes\nThere are lots of genes in this dataset therefore we will take a slightly different approach. We would not want to use plot a distribution for each gene in the same way. Will pivot the data to tidy and then summarise the counts for each gene.\n🎬 Summarise the counts for each gene and save the result as pro_meta_summary_gene. Include the same columns as we had in the by sample summary (pro_meta_summary_samp) and an additional column, total for the total number of counts for each gene.\n🎬 View the pro_meta_summary_gene dataframe.\nNotice that we have:\n\na lot of genes with counts of zero in every sample\na lot of genes with zero counts in several of the samples\nsome very very low counts.\n\nGenes with very low counts should be filtered out because they are unreliable - or, at the least, uninformative. The goal of our downstream analysis will be to see if there is a significant difference in gene expression between the stages. Since we have only three replicates in each group, having one or two unreliable, missing or zero values, makes such a determination impossible for a particular gene. We will use the total counts (total) and the number of samples with non-zero values (n_above_zero) in this dataframe to filter our genes later.\nAs we have a lot of genes, it is helpful to plot the mean counts with geom_pointrange() to get an overview of the distributions. We will again plot the log of the mean counts. We will also order the genes from lowest to highest mean count.\n🎬 Plot the logged mean counts for each gene in order of size using geom_pointrange():\n\npro_meta_summary_gene |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gene_id, mean), y = log10(mean))) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = log10(mean - sd), \n                      ymax = log10(mean + sd )),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note the warning is expected since we have zero means).\nYou can see we also have quite a few genes with means less than 1 (log below zero). Note that the variability between genes (average counts between 0 and 349606) is far greater than between samples (average counts from 220 to 364) which is exactly what we would expect to see.\nNow go to Filtering for QC."

This helps me avoid cluttering my R environment with temporary objects.\n🎬 Pivot the counts (stack the columns) so all the counts are in a single column (expr) labelled in cell by the column it came from and pipe into ggplot() to create a histogram:\n\nhspc_prog |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -ensembl_gene_id,\n               names_to = \"cell\",\n               values_to = \"expr\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = expr)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very striking distribution. Is it what we are expecting? Notice we have a peak at zero indicating there are low values zeros. This inflation of low values suggests some are anomalous - they will have been derived from low counts which are likely false positives. As inaccurate measures, we will want to exclude expression values below (about) 1. We will revisit this after we have considered the distribution of expression across cells and genes.\nWhat about the bimodal appearance of the the ‘real’ values? If we had the whole transcriptome we would not expect to see such a pattern - we’d expect to see a roughly normal distribution3. However, this is a subset of the genome and the nature of the subsetting has had an influence here. These are a subset of cell surface proteins that show a significant difference between at least two of twelve cell subtypes. That is, all of these genes are either “high” or “low” leading to a bimodal distribution.\nUnlike the other three datasets, which count raw counts, these data are normalised and log2 transformed. We do not need to plot the log of the values to see the distribution - they are already logged.\nDistribution of values across the samples\nFor the other three datasets, we used the summary() function to get an overview of the columns. This works well when you have upto about 25 columns but it is not helpful here because we have a lot of cells! Feel free to try it!\nIn this data set, there is even more of an advantage of using the pivot_longer(), group_by() and summarise() approach. We will be able to open the dataframe in the Viewer and make plots to examine whether the distributions are similar across cells. The mean and the standard deviation are useful to see the distributions across cells in a plot but we will also examine the interquartile values, maximums and the number of non-zero values.\n🎬 Summarise all the cells:\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell &lt;- hspc_prog |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -ensembl_gene_id,\n               names_to = \"cell\",\n               values_to = \"expr\") |&gt;\n  group_by(cell) |&gt;\n  summarise(min = min(expr),\n            lowerq = quantile(expr, 0.25),\n            sd = sd(expr),\n            mean = mean(expr),\n            median = median(expr),\n            upperq = quantile(expr, 0.75),\n            max = max(expr),\n            total = sum(expr),\n            n_above_zero = sum(expr &gt; 0))\n\n🎬 View the hspc_prog_summary_cell dataframe (click on it in the environment).\nNotice that: - a minimum value of 0 appears in all 1499 cells - the lower quartiles are all zero and so are many of the medians - there are no cells with above 0 expression in all 280 of the gene subset - the highest number of genes expressed is 208, the lowest is 94\nIn short, there are quite a lot of zeros.\nTo get a better understanding of the distribution of expressions in cells we can create a ggplot using the pointrange geom. Pointrange puts a dot at the mean and a line between a minimum and a maximum such as +/- one standard deviation. Not unlike a boxplot, but when you need the boxes too be very narrow!\n🎬 Create a pointrange plot.\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = cell, y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd ),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to use the Zoom button to pop the plot window out so you can make it as wide as possible\nThe things to notice are:\n\nthe average expression in cells is similar for all cells. This is good to know - if some cells had much lower expression perhaps there is something wrong with them, or their sequencing, and they should be excluded.\nthe distributions are roughly similar in width too\n\nThe default order of cell is alphabetical. It can be easier to judge if there are unusual cells if we order the lines by the size of the mean.\n🎬 Order a pointrange plot with reorder(variable_to_order, order_by).\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(cell, mean), y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd ),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreorder() arranges cell in increasing size of mean\nAs we thought, the distributions are similar across cells - there are not any cells that are obviously different from the others (only incrementally).\nDistribution of values across the genes\nWe will use the same approach to summarise the genes.\n🎬 Summarise the expression for each gene and save the result as hspc_prog_summary_gene. Include the same columns as we had in the by cell summary (hspc_prog_summary_cell) and an additional column, total for the total expression for each gene.\n🎬 View the hspc_prog_summary_gene dataframe. Remember these are normalised and logged (base 2) so we should not see very large values.\nNotice that we have:\n\nsome genes (7) expressed in every cell, and many expressed in most cells\nquite a few genes with zero in many cells but this matters less when we have many cells (samples) than when we have few samples.\nno genes with zeros in every cell - the lowest number of cells is\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is again helpful to plot the ordered mean expression with pointrange to get an overview.\n🎬 Plot the logged mean counts for each gene in order of size using geom_pointrange():\n\nhspc_prog_summary_gene |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(ensembl_gene_id, mean), y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the variability between genes (average expression between 0.020 and and 9.567) is far greater than between cells (average expression from 1.319 to 9.567) which is just what we would expect.\nNow go to Filtering for QC."

In other words unexpressed genes have already been filtered out. However, it is good practices to verify there are no unexpressed genes before we embark on our analysis.\nWhere the sum of all the values in the rows is zero, all the entries must be zero. We can use this to find any the genes that are not expressed in any of the cells. To do row wise aggregates such as the sum across rows we can use the rowwise() function. c_across() allows us to use the colon notation to select columns. This is very useful when you have a lot of columns because it would be annoying to have to list all of them HSPC_001:Prog_852 means all the columns from HSPC_001 to Prog_852.\n🎬 Find the genes that are 0 in every column of the hspc_prog dataframe:\n\nhspc_prog |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  filter(sum(c_across(HSPC_001:Prog_852)) == 0)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 1,500\n# Rowwise: \n# ℹ 1,500 variables: ensembl_gene_id &lt;chr&gt;, HSPC_001 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_002 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_003 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_004 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_006 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_008 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_009 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_011 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_012 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_014 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_015 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_016 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_017 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_018 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_020 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_021 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_022 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_023 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_024 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_025 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_026 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_027 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_028 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_030 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_031 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_033 &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nNotice that we have summed across all the columns.\n❓ What do you conclude?\n\n\n🎬 Write combined data to file:\n\nwrite_csv(hspc_prog, \n          file = \"data-processed/hspc_prog.csv\")\n\nNow go to Look after future you"

These are important in understanding both how to assemble, curate and document your “Supporting Information” and how to work reproducibly so future you (Spring semester you) can painlessly work with past you and your work is demonstrably repeatable. This is essential because you will want to be able to set work aside for holidays and assessment periods and then restart easily. The Supporting Information you submit with your Report will be be assessed on its organisation, reproducibility and documentation.\nBIO00070M students do week 1 and 6 of the core workshops along with weeks 3, 4 and 5 of transcriptomics.\n\n\nWhy reproducibility matters, project-oriented workflow, organisation and naming things. You will also learn how to recognise and write cool 😎 code, not 😩 ugly code and code algorithmically and discover some awesome short cuts to help you write cool 😎 code.\n\n\n\nDocumenting your Supporting Information with a read me and appropriate code commenting, curating code, non-coded processing",

    "text": "📖 Read Understanding file systems. This is an approximately 15 - 20 minute read revising file types and file systems. It covers concepts of working directories and paths. We learned these ideas in stage 1 and but if you don’t feel completely confident with revisting might help. For BIO00070M students, this is part of the work you will also be asked to complete for BIO00052M Data Analysis in R.\n📖 Read Workflow in RStudio. You may find it helpful to remind yourself about RStudio Projects. In previous years, BIO00088H students have submitted an “RStudio Project” as part of your BABS work. Here, you will submit “Supporting Information” for your Project Report. The Supporting Information is a documented and organised collection of all the digital parts of your research project. This includes data (or instructions for accessing data), code and/or non-coded processing, instructions for use, computational requirements and outputs. The Supporting Information could be a single RStudio Project (like you have done previously but with better documentation) or a folder that includes an RStudio Project and other material/scripts. BIO00070M students do not need to submit “Supporting Information”.\nSet up the Virtual Desktop Service. I very strongly recommend working on the University computers for this work. You will be using more specialised R packages than you might be used to. This is especially important if you often have difficulty updating and or installing software on your own machine, wouldn’t know what what version of R you are using or don’t realise there is a difference between R and RStudio. The uni machines always have up-to-date R and R packages and all the packages that appear in teaching materials. It is our responsibility to ensure everything works on here. The Virtual Desktop Service allows you to log on to a university computer from your home computer. It means you can access all software and filestores. When using the VDS for R and RStudio, it usually makes sense to use other software - such as a browser or file explorer - also through the VDS.\n\nIf you are confident in your ability to set up your own machine, you need:\n\nto know the difference between R and RStudio\nto use R 4.5 and RStudio 2025.05.0+496 “Mariposa Orchid” Release which includes Quarto 1.7.30 (C:/Program Files/Quarto/bin/quarto.exe)\nbe certain you are actually using R 4.5 - it is written in the top edge of the console window. By default RStudio uses the latest version on R on your machine. However, windows users are able to change this to a “specific version”. You might have done that previously. Change it back using Tools | Global Options R version “Use your machine’s default 64-bit version of R”\nto make sure you do the independent study where it tells you what steps you need to take to get packages (and versions that are unlikely to cause issues) used in the workshop\n\nIt is possible to access all your files on your university account without using the VDS. For example, if you want to work on uni machines at uni and your machine at home. You can best do this by mapping a drive: https://support.york.ac.uk/s/topic/0TO4K000000lA5ZWAU/filestores. If you store everything on google drive you can also read/write to that like any other drive using google drive app.\nEven if you plan to use your own machine I really recommend you take the time to set the VDS up now while you’re not time pressured so you always have that option ready.",

You do not need to teach a person to program in the comments, but you should explain the logic of the code and the decisions you make based on what you see in your analysis. If you remove the code, the comments should still make sense. Good commenting can be a solid basis for your methods section. You need not interpret the results in any depth, but you should comment on interpretation where it impacts what you do in the code.",

It does not have to match the title of the report but why give yourself more thinking!\nThe description should be a brief summary of the project. It should include the aim of the project and the methods used. It should be written in plain language so that someone who is not familiar with the field can understand it. It is likely to be similar to a report abstract but with less emphasis on introduction/background and discussion and more detail on the the methods.\n\n\nStart date, last updated date, contact information\nWe date our work so others know how old it is and when it was last updated. The very best READMEs are updated every time the project is updated so there is a “change log” at the top of the file. This is a list of changes made to the project with the date they were made. This especially useful in collaborative projects when you are not using a version control system. Sometimes, the change log is in a separate file called CHANGELOG.md. or similar.\n\n\nDescription of Project organisation\nYour aim is to organise your project and name files and files so that the organisation is clear to someone who has never seen it before. You are are aiming for “speaks for itself” organisation. However, you still need to give an overview of the organisation in the README. This should include the names of the folders and what is in them. You can also include a diagram of the project organisation if you like. Make sure it is easy for readers to distinguish between code, data, and outputs. Also explain your file naming convention along with any abbreviations or codes you have used.\n\n\nSoftware requirements\nYou should list the software you used in your project. This should include the version of the software you used. This is important for reproducibility.\nThere are packages that give session information in R and Python\nR: sessioninfo (Wickham et al. 2021)\nsessioninfo::session_info()\nPython: session_info (Ostblom, Joel 2019)\nimport session_info\nsession_info.show()\nFiji:\nCite\n\n\nData description\nYou should describe all the data used in the project. This should include where the data came from, how it was collected, and any processing that was done to it. You may need to include links to the data sources. Include a “data dictionary” which describes the variables in the data and what they mean. This is especially important since most variable names are abbreviations or codes.\n\n\nInstructions for use\nThe last part of the README should be instructions for how to use it. You want to describe to reader what they need to do to recreate the results you present in your report. This should include:\n\nBrief description of the code structure especially if you have used a a mix of languages and scripts\nInstructions to run the code and reproduce the figures or other outputs in the report\nAny other information that needed to understand and recreate the work\n\n🎬 Write a README file for your project.",

In the workshop, you will learn what steps to take to get a good understanding of transcriptomics data before you consider any statistical analysis. This is an often overlooked, but very valuable and informative, part of any data pipeline. It gives you the deep understanding of the data structures and values that you will need to code and trouble-shoot code, allows you to spot failed or problematic samples and informs your decisions on quality control.\nWe suggest you sit together with your group in the workshop.\n\nLearning objectives\nThe successful student will be able to:\n\nexplore transcriptomics data to find the number of rows and columns and know how these correspond to samples and variables\nexplore the distribution of expression measures across whole data sets, across variables and across samples by summarising and plotting\nexplain what distributions are expected and interpret the distributions they have\nexplain on what basis we might filter out variables or samples\nimport, explore and filter transcriptomics data reproducibly so they can understand and reuse their code in the future\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nPrepare\n\n📖 Read how the data were generated and how they have been processed so far and a summary of the analysis we will carry out over three workshops.\n\nWorkshop\n\n💻 Set up a Project\n💻 Import data\n💻 Explore the distribution of values across rows and columns\n💻 Look after future you!\n\nConsolidate\n\n💻 Use the work you completed in the workshop as a template to apply to a new case.",

We can see that the first component explains 0.10652 of the variance, the second 0.05456, and the third 0.02952. Together the first three components explain 19.06% of the total variance in the data. This is not that high but it is also quite a lot better than than we would get plotting any two genes randomly chosen against each other.\nTo plot the PC1 against PC2 we will need to extract the PC1 and PC2 “scores” from the PCA object and add labels for the cells. Our PCA object is called pca and the scores are in pca$x. The cells labels will come from the row names of the transformed data.\n🎬 Create a dataframe of the PC1 and PC2 scores (in pca$x) and add the cell ids:\n\npca_labelled &lt;- data.frame(pca$x,\n                           cell_id = row.names(hspc_prog_trans))\n\nIt will be helpful to add a column for the cell type so we can label points. One way to do this is to extract the information in the cell_id column into two columns: one with the complete cell id and one with just the cell type. This extraction is done with Regular Expression magic.\n🎬 Extract the cell type and cell number from the cell_id column (keeping the cell_id column):\n\npca_labelled &lt;- pca_labelled |&gt; \n  extract(cell_id, \n          remove = FALSE,\n          c(\"cell_type\", \"cell_number\"),\n          \"([a-zA-Z]{4})_([0-9]{3})\")\n\nWhat this code does is take what is in the cell_id column (something like Prog_001 or HSPC_001) and split it into two columns (“cell_type” and “cell_number”). The reason why we want to do that is to colour the points by cell type. We would not want to use cell_id to colour the points because each cell id is unique and that would be 1000+ colours. The last argument in the extract() function is the pattern to match described with a regular expression. Three patterns are being matched, and two of those are in brackets meaning they are kept to fill the two new columns.\nThe first pattern is ([a-zA-Z]{4})\n\nit is brackets because we want to keep it and put it in cell_type\n\n\n[a-zA-Z] means any lower (a-z) or upper case letter (A-Z).\nThe square brackets means any of the characters in the square brackets will be matched\n\n{4} means 4 of them.\n\nSo the first pattern inside the first (…) will match exactly 4 upper or lower case letters (like Prog or HSPC)\nThe second pattern is _ to match the underscore in every cell id that separates the cell type from the number. It is not in brackets because we do not want to keep it.\nThe third pattern is ([0-9]{3})\n\n\n[0-9] means any number\n\n{3} means 3 of them.\n\nSo the second pattern inside the second (…) will match exactly 3 numbers (like 001 or 851).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant for applying to other comparisons\n\n\n\nProg and HPSC have 4 letters. The column names with LT.HSC_ have 6 characters and includes a dot. You will need to adjust the regex when comparing LT-HSC to other cell types. The pattern to match the LT.HSC as well as the Prog and HSPC is ([a-zA-Z.]{4,6}). Note the dot inside the square brackets and numbers meaning either 4 or 6 of the characters in the [].

You can also try plotting PC3 or PC4 (or others).\nI prefer to customise the colours. I especially like the viridis colour scales which provide colour scales that are perceptually uniform in both colour and black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness. See Introduction to viridis for more information.\nggplot provides functions to access the viridis scales. Here I use scale_fill_viridis_d(). The d stands for discrete used because cell type is a discrete variable. The function scale_fill_viridis_c() would be used for continuous data. I’ve used the default “viridis” (or “D”) option (do ?scale_fill_viridis_d for all the options) and used the begin and end arguments to control the range of colour - I have set the range to be from 0.15 to 0.95 the avoid the strongest contrast. I have also set the name argument to NULL because that the legend refers to cell types is obvious.\n🎬 Plot PC2 against PC1 and colour by cell type:\n\npca_labelled |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, \n             colour = cell_type)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.95, begin = 0.15,\n                         name = NULL) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go to Volcano plots for 🐭 Stem cells",

You could perform this transformation within the plot command without adding a column to the data if you prefer.\n🎬 Add a column to the results dataframe that contains the -log10(FDR):\n\nhspc_prog_results &lt;- hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  mutate(log10_FDR = -log10(FDR)) \n\n🎬 Create a volcano plot of the results:\n\nhspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = summary.logFC, \n             y = log10_FDR)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur dashed lines are at -log10(0.05) and log2(2) and log2(-2) to make more clear which genes (points) are significantly different between the cell types and have a fold change of at least 2.\nIn most cases, people colour the points to show that the quadrants. I like to add columns to the dataframe to indicate if the gene is significant and if the fold change is large and use those variables in the plot.\n🎬 Add columns to the results dataframe to indicate if the gene is significant and if the fold change is large:\n\nhspc_prog_results &lt;- hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  mutate(sig = FDR &lt;= 0.05,\n         bigfc = abs(summary.logFC) &gt;= 2) \n\nThe use of abs() (absolute) means genes with a fold change of at least 2 in either direction will be considered to have a large fold change.\nNow we can colour the points by these new columns. I use interaction() to create four categories:\n\nnot significant and not large fold change (FF)\nsignificant and not large fold change (TF)\nnot significant and large fold (FT)\nsignificant and large fold change (TT)\n\nAnd I use scale_colour_manual() to set the colours for these categories.\nNOTE: there are no “not significant and large fold change (FT)” in this case. This means we do not need four colours. I have put the “gray30” colour in the code but commented it out.\n🎬 Create a volcano plot of the results with the points coloured by significance and fold change:\n\nhspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = summary.logFC, \n             y = log10_FDR, \n             colour = interaction(sig, bigfc))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \n                                 \"pink\",\n                                # \"gray30\",\n                                 \"deeppink\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor exploring the data, I like add labels to all the significant genes with a large fold change so I can very quickly identity them. The ggrepel package has a function geom_text_repel() that is useful for adding labels so that they don’t overlap.\n🎬 Load the package:\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n🎬 Add labels to the significant genes with a large fold change:\n\nhspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = summary.logFC, \n             y = log10_FDR, \n             colour = interaction(sig, bigfc))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \n                                 \"pink\",\n                              #   \"gray30\",\n                                 \"deeppink\")) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n                    filter(bigfc == TRUE, sig == TRUE),\n                  aes(label = external_gene_name),\n                  size = 3,\n                  max.overlaps = 50) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that I have used filter() label only the genes that are both significant and have a large fold change. In systems you are familiar with, this labelling is very informative and can help you quickly identify common themes. Key to interpreting the volcano plot is to remember that positive fold changes means the gene is up-regulated in the Prog and negative fold changes means the gene is down-regulated (i.e., higher HSPC). This was determined by us choosing the results_hspc_prog$prog dataframe from the list object\nIf you do forget which way round you did the comparison, you can always examine the gene summary dataframe to see which of the treatments seem to be higher for the positive fold changes.\nWhen you have a gene of interest, you may wish to label it on the plot. This is done in the same way except that you filter the data to only include the gene of interest. I have used and then use geom_label_repel() rather than geom_text_repel() to put the label in a box and nudged it’s position to get a line connecting the point and the label. I have also increased the size of the point.\n🎬 Add a label to one gene of interest Emilin2 (I made an arbitrary choice):\n\nhspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = summary.logFC, \n             y = log10_FDR, \n             colour = interaction(sig, bigfc))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \n                                 \"pink\",\n                                # \"gray30\",\n                                 \"deeppink\")) +\n  geom_label_repel(data = hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n                    filter(external_gene_name == \"Emilin2\"),\n                  aes(label = external_gene_name),\n                  size = 4) +\n  geom_point(data = hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n                    filter(external_gene_name == \"Emilin2\"),\n                size = 3) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you want to label more than one gene, you will need to use (for example): filter(external_gene_name %in% c(\"Emilin2\", \"Col5a1\"))\nNow go to Save your plots",
