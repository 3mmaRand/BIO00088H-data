The sibling pairs do not seem to cluster together. You can also try plotting PC3 or PC4.\nI prefer to customise the colours and shapes. I especially like the\nviridis colour scales which provide colour scales that are perceptually uniform in both colour and black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness. See Introduction to viridis for more information.\nggplot provides functions to access the viridis scales. Here I use scale_fill_viridis_d(). The d stands for discrete. The function scale_fill_viridis_c() would be used for continuous data. I‚Äôve used the default ‚Äúviridis‚Äù (or ‚ÄúD‚Äù) option (do ?scale_fill_viridis_d for all the options) and used the begin and end arguments to control the range of colour - I have set the range to be from 0.15 to 0.95 the avoid the strongest contrast. I have also set the name argument to provide a label for the legend.\nI have used scale_shape_manual() to set the shapes for the treatments. I have used the values 21 and 19 which are the codes for filled and open circles and filled triangles. I have set the name argument to NULL to remove the label (it‚Äôs obvious what that categories are treatments) and the labels argument to improve the legend.\nüé¨ Plot PC2 against PC1 and colour by sibling pair and shape by treatment:\n\npca_labelled |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, \n             colour = sibling_rep,\n             shape = treatment)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.95, begin = 0.15,\n                         name = \"Sibling pair\") +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21, 19),\n                     name = NULL,\n                     labels = c(\"Control\", \"FGF-Treated\")) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go to Volcano plots for üê∏ Frog development",

We will create a dataframe of the scores and add the sample ids.\nüé¨ Create a dataframe of PC1 and PC2 scores and add the sample ids:\n\npca_labelled &lt;- data.frame(pca$x,\n                           sample_id)\n\nüé¨ Merge with the metadata so we can label points by life cycle stage:\n\npca_labelled &lt;- pca_labelled |&gt; \n  left_join(meta_pro_meta, \n            by = \"sample_id\")\n\nSince the metadata contained the sample ids, it was especially important to remove the log2_ from the row names so that the join would work.\nThe dataframe should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC1\nPC2\nPC3\nPC4\nsample_id\nstage\nreplicate\n\n\n\n-59.42107\n-2.922229\n-11.043368\n-13.4641060\nlm_pro_1\nprocyclic\n1\n\n\n-63.25818\n-15.985856\n-36.248191\n0.7025242\nlm_pro_2\nprocyclic\n2\n\n\n-57.92065\n25.679645\n47.373874\n13.7893070\nlm_pro_3\nprocyclic\n3\n\n\n56.20326\n-59.707787\n5.958727\n31.5528028\nlm_meta_1\nmetacyclic\n1\n\n\n57.41205\n-11.738157\n14.157242\n-47.2285609\nlm_meta_2\nmetacyclic\n2\n\n\n66.98459\n64.674383\n-20.198284\n14.6480329\nlm_meta_3\nmetacyclic\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next task is to plot PC2 against PC1 and colour by sibling pair. This is just a scatterplot so we can use geom_point(). We will use colour to indicate the life cycle stage.\nüé¨ Plot PC2 against PC1 and colour by copper conditions:\n\npca_labelled |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, \n             colour = stage)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a good separation between treatments on PCA1. The replicates do seem to cluster together. You can also try plotting PC3 or PC4.\nI prefer to customise the colours. I especially like the\nviridis colour scales which provide colour scales that are perceptually uniform in both colour and black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness. See Introduction to viridis for more information.\nggplot provides functions to access the viridis scales. Here I use scale_fill_viridis_d(). The d stands for discrete. The function scale_fill_viridis_c() would be used for continuous data. I‚Äôve used the default ‚Äúviridis‚Äù (or ‚ÄúD‚Äù) option (do ?scale_fill_viridis_d for all the options) and used the begin and end arguments to control the range of colour - I have set the range to be from 0.15 to 0.95 the avoid the strongest contrast. I have also set the name argument to provide a label for the legend.\nüé¨ Plot PC2 against PC1 and colour by life stage:\n\npca_labelled |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, \n             colour = stage)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.95, begin = 0.15,\n                         name = \"Stage\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go to Volcano plots for üíâ Leishmania",

We then use the t() function to transpose the dataframe. We then convert the resulting matrix to a dataframe using data.frame(). If you view that dataframe you‚Äôll see it has default column name which we can fix using colnames() to set the column names to the gene ids.\nüé¨ Set the column names to the gene ids:\n\ncolnames(hspc_prog_trans) &lt;- hspc_prog_results$ensembl_gene_id\n\nüé¨ Perform PCA on the log2 transformed normalised counts:\n\npca &lt;- hspc_prog_trans |&gt;\n  prcomp(rank. = 8)\n\nThe rank. argument tells prcomp() to only calculate the first 8 principal components. This is useful for visualisation as we can only plot in 2 or 3 dimensions. We can see the results of the PCA by viewing the summary() of the pca object.\n\nsummary(pca)\n\nImportance of first k=8 (out of 280) components:\n                           PC1     PC2     PC3     PC4     PC5     PC6     PC7\nStandard deviation     12.5612 8.36646 5.98988 5.41386 4.55730 4.06142 3.84444\nProportion of Variance  0.1099 0.04874 0.02498 0.02041 0.01446 0.01149 0.01029\nCumulative Proportion   0.1099 0.15861 0.18359 0.20400 0.21846 0.22995 0.24024\n                           PC8\nStandard deviation     3.70848\nProportion of Variance 0.00958\nCumulative Proportion  0.24982\n\n\nThe Proportion of Variance tells us how much of the variance is explained by each component. We can see that the first component explains 0.1099 of the variance, the second 0.04874, and the third 0.02498. Together the first three components explain 18% of the total variance in the data. This is not that high but it is also quite a lot better than than we would get plotting any two genes randomly chosen against each other.\nTo plot the PC1 against PC2 we will need to extract the PC1 and PC2 ‚Äúscores‚Äù from the PCA object and add labels for the cells. Our PCA object is called pca and the scores are in pca$x. The cells labels will come from the row names of the transformed data.\nüé¨ Create a dataframe of the PC1 and PC2 scores (in pca$x) and add the cell ids:\n\npca_labelled &lt;- data.frame(pca$x,\n                           cell_id = row.names(hspc_prog_trans))\n\nIt will be helpful to add a column for the cell type so we can label points. One way to do this is to extract the information in the cell_id column into two columns: one with the complete cell id and one with just the cell type. This extraction is done with Regular Expression magic.\nüé¨ Extract the cell type and cell number from the cell_id column (keeping the cell_id column):\n\npca_labelled &lt;- pca_labelled |&gt; \n  extract(cell_id, \n          remove = FALSE,\n          c(\"cell_type\", \"cell_number\"),\n          \"([a-zA-Z]{4})_([0-9]{3})\")\n\nWhat this code does is take what is in the cell_id column (something like Prog_001 and HSPC_001) and split it into two columns (‚Äúcell_type‚Äù and ‚Äúcell_number‚Äù). The reason why we want to do that is to colour the points by cell type (we don‚Äôt want to colour by cell number because that would be 1000+ colours). How it does that is by matching the pattern before the _ and matching the pattern after _. Each pattern is inside a set of (). Patterns are matched with regular expression\n\"([a-zA-Z]{4})_([0-9]{3})\" is a regular expression - or regex.\n\n\n[a-zA-Z] means any lower (a-z) or upper case letter (A-Z).\nThe square brackets means any of the characters in the square brackets will be matched\n{4} means 4 of them.\nSo the first pattern inside the first () will match exactly 4 upper or lower case letters (like Prog or HSPC)\n[0-9] means any number,\n{3} means 3 of them.\nSo the second pattern inside the second () will match exactly 3 numbers (like 001 or 851)\nThe _ between the two patterns matches the underscore and the fact it isn‚Äôt in a set of () means we do not want to keep it.\n\nImportant: Prog and HPSC have 4 letters. The column names, LT.HSPC_ have 6 characters and includes a dot. You will need to adjust the regex when make comparison between LT-HSPC and other cell types. The pattern to match the LT.HSPC as well as the Prog and HSPC is ([a-zA-Z.]{4, 6}).

next task is to plot PC2 against PC1 and colour by cell type. This is just a scatterplot so we can use geom_point(). We will use colour to indicate the sibling pair and shape to indicate the treatment.\nüé¨ Plot PC2 against PC1 and colour by copper conditions:\n\npca_labelled |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, \n             colour = cell_type)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a good clustering of cell types but plenty of overlap. You can also try plotting PC3 or PC4 (or others).\nI prefer to customise the colours. I especially like the\nviridis colour scales which provide colour scales that are perceptually uniform in both colour and black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness. See Introduction to viridis for more information.\nggplot provides functions to access the viridis scales. Here I use scale_fill_viridis_d(). The d stands for discrete. The function scale_fill_viridis_c() would be used for continuous data. I‚Äôve used the default ‚Äúviridis‚Äù (or ‚ÄúD‚Äù) option (do ?scale_fill_viridis_d for all the options) and used the begin and end arguments to control the range of colour - I have set the range to be from 0.15 to 0.95 the avoid the strongest contrast. I have also set the name argument to NULL because that the legend referes to cell types is obvious.\nüé¨ Plot PC2 against PC1 and colour by life stage:\n\npca_labelled |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, \n             colour = cell_type)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.95, begin = 0.15,\n                         name = NULL) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go to Volcano plots for üê≠ Stem cells",

You could perform this transformation within the plot command without adding a column to the data if you prefer.\nüé¨ Add a column to the results dataframe that contains the -log10(padj):\n\ns30_results &lt;- s30_results |&gt; \n  mutate(log10_padj = -log10(padj)) \n\nüé¨ Create a volcano plot of the results:\n\ns30_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = log2FoldChange, \n             y = log10_padj)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur dashed lines are at -log10(0.05) and log2(2) and log2(-2) to make more clear which genes (points) are significantly different between the control and the FGF-treated samples and have a fold change of at least 2.\nIn most cases, people colour the points to show that the quadrants.

You could perform this transformation within the plot command without adding a column to the data if you prefer.\nüé¨ Add a column to the results dataframe that contains the -log10(FDR):\n\nhspc_prog_results &lt;- hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  mutate(log10_FDR = -log10(FDR)) \n\nüé¨ Create a volcano plot of the results:\n\nhspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = summary.logFC, \n             y = log10_FDR)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur dashed lines are at -log10(0.05) and log2(2) and log2(-2) to make more clear which genes (points) are significantly different between the cell types and have a fold change of at least 2.\nIn most cases, people colour the points to show that the quadrants. I like to add columns to the dataframe to indicate if the gene is significant and if the fold change is large and use those variables in the plot.\nüé¨ Add columns to the results dataframe to indicate if the gene is significant and if the fold change is large:\n\nhspc_prog_results &lt;- hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  mutate(sig = FDR &lt;= 0.05,\n         bigfc = abs(summary.logFC) &gt;= 2) \n\nThe use of abs() (absolute) means genes with a fold change of at least 2 in either direction will be considered to have a large fold change.\nNow we can colour the points by these new columns. I use interaction() to create four categories:\n\nnot significant and not large fold change (FF)\nsignificant and not large fold change (TF)\nnot significant and large fold (FT)\nsignificant and large fold change (TT)\n\nAnd I use scale_colour_manual() to set the colours for these categories.\nNOTE: there are no ‚Äúnot significant and large fold change (FT)‚Äù in this case. This means we do not need four colours. I have put the ‚Äúgray30‚Äù colour in the code but commented it out.\nüé¨ Create a volcano plot of the results with the points coloured by significance and fold change:\n\nhspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = summary.logFC, \n             y = log10_FDR, \n             colour = interaction(sig, bigfc))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \n                                 \"pink\",\n                                # \"gray30\",\n                                 \"deeppink\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor exploring the data, I like add labels to all the significant genes with a large fold change so I can very quickly identity them. The ggrepel package has a function geom_text_repel() that is useful for adding labels so that they don‚Äôt overlap.\nüé¨ Load the package:\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nüé¨ Add labels to the significant genes with a large fold change:\n\nhspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = summary.logFC, \n             y = log10_FDR, \n             colour = interaction(sig, bigfc))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \n                                 \"pink\",\n                              #   \"gray30\",\n                                 \"deeppink\")) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n                    filter(bigfc == TRUE, sig == TRUE),\n                  aes(label = external_gene_name),\n                  size = 3,\n                  max.overlaps = 50) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that I have used filter() label only the genes that are both significant and have a large fold change. In systems you are familiar with, this labelling is very informative and can help you quickly identify common themes. Key to interpreting the volcano plot is to remember that positive fold changes means the gene is up-regulated in the Prog and negative fold changes means the gene is down-regulated (i.e., higher HSPC). This was determined by us choosing the results_hspc_prog$prog dataframe from the list object\nIf you do forget which way round you did the comparison, you can always examine the gene summary dataframe to see which of the treatments seem to be higher for the positive fold changes.\nWhen you have a gene of interest, you may wish to label it on the plot. This is done in the same way except that you filter the data to only include the gene of interest. I have used and then use geom_label_repel() rather than geom_text_repel() to put the label in a box and nudged it‚Äôs position to get a line connecting the point and the label. I have also increased the size of the point.\nüé¨ Add a label to one gene of interest (Procr) and :\n\nhspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = summary.logFC, \n             y = log10_FDR, \n             colour = interaction(sig, bigfc))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \n                                 \"pink\",\n                                # \"gray30\",\n                                 \"deeppink\")) +\n  geom_label_repel(data = hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n                    filter(external_gene_name == \"Procr\"),\n                  aes(label = external_gene_name),\n                  size = 4,\n                  nudge_x = .5,\n                  nudge_y = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(data = hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n                    filter(external_gene_name == \"Procr\"),\n                size = 3) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go to Save your plots",

We could save a copy of the stacked data and then plot it, but here, I have just piped the stacked data straight into ggplot(). This helps me avoid cluttering my R environment with temporary objects.\nüé¨ Pivot the counts (stack the columns) so all the counts are in a single column (count) labelled in sample by the column it came from and pipe into ggplot() to create a histogram:\n\ns30 |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -xenbase_gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = count)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data is very skewed - there are very many low counts and a very few higher numbers. It is hard to see the very low bars for the higher values. Logging the counts is a way to make the distribution more visible. You cannot take the log of 0 so we add 1 to the count before logging. The log of 1 is zero so we will be able to see how many zeros we had.\nüé¨ Repeat the plot of log of the counts.\n\ns30 |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -xenbase_gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = log10(count + 1))) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI‚Äôve used base 10 only because it easy to convert to the original scale (1 is 10, 2 is 100, 3 is 1000 etc). Notice we have a peak at zero indicating there are many zeros. We would expect the distribution of counts to be roughly log normal because this is expression of all the genes in the genome1. The number of low counts is inflated (small peak near the low end). This suggests that these lower counts might be false positives. The removal of low counts is a common processing step in ‚Äôomic data. We will revisit this after we have considered the distribution of counts across samples and genes.\nDistribution of values across the samples\nSummary statistics including the the number of NAs can be seen using the summary(). It is most helpful which you have up to about 25 columns. There is nothing special about the number 25, it is just that summaries of a larger number of columns are difficult to grasp.\nüé¨ Get a quick overview of the 7 columns:\n\n# examine all the columns quickly\n# works well with smaller numbers of column\nsummary(s30)\n\n xenbase_gene_id       S30_C_1            S30_C_2            S30_C_3        \n Length:11893       Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:    14.0   1st Qu.:    14.0   1st Qu.:    23.0  \n Mode  :character   Median :    70.0   Median :    75.0   Median :   107.0  \n                    Mean   :   317.1   Mean   :   335.8   Mean   :   426.3  \n                    3rd Qu.:   205.0   3rd Qu.:   220.0   3rd Qu.:   301.0  \n                    Max.   :101746.0   Max.   :118708.0   Max.   :117945.0  \n    S30_F_1            S30_F_2            S30_F_3       \n Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :    0.0  \n 1st Qu.:    19.0   1st Qu.:    17.0   1st Qu.:   16.0  \n Median :    88.0   Median :    84.0   Median :   69.0  \n Mean   :   376.2   Mean   :   376.5   Mean   :  260.4  \n 3rd Qu.:   251.0   3rd Qu.:   246.0   3rd Qu.:  187.0  \n Max.   :117573.0   Max.   :130672.0   Max.   :61531.0  \n\n\nNotice that:\n\nthe minimum count is 0 and the maximums are very high in all the columns\nthe medians are quite a lot lower than the means so the data are skewed (hump to the left, tail to the right) and there must be quite a lot of zeros\n\nS30_F_3 does have a somewhat lower maximum count\n\nWe want to know how many zeros there are in each a column. To achieve this, we can make use of the fact that TRUE evaluates to 1 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Consequently, summing a column of TRUE/FALSE values will give you the number of TRUE values. For example, sum(S30_C_1 &gt; 0) gives the number of values above zero in the S30_C_1 column.

This is good because it means that the samples are fairly consistent with each other. We can now move on to the next step.\nDistribution of values across the genes\nThere are lots of genes in this dataset therefore we will take a slightly different approach. We would not want to use plot a distribution for each gene in the same way.

The goal of our downstream analysis will be to see if there is a significant difference in gene expression between the control and FGF-treated sibling. Since we have only three replicates in each group, having one or two unreliable, missing or zero values, makes such a determination impossible for a particular gene. We will use the total counts (total) and the number of samples with non-zero values (n_above_zero) in this dataframe to filter our genes later.\nAs we have a lot of genes, it is helpful to plot the mean counts with geom_pointrange() to get an overview of the distributions.

We will revisit this after we have considered the distribution of counts across samples and genes.\nDistribution of values across the samples\nSummary statistics including the the number of NAs can be seen using the summary(). It is most helpful which you have up to about 25 columns. There is nothing special about the number 25, it is just that summaries of a larger number of columns are difficult to grasp.\nüé¨ Get a quick overview of the 5 columns:\n\n# examine all the columns quickly\n# works well with smaller numbers of column\nsummary(wild)\n\n   gene_id          SRX028956_wild_suf SRX028957_wild_def SRX028960_wild_suf\n Length:32833       Min.   :    0.0    Min.   :    0.00   Min.   :    0.0   \n Class :character   1st Qu.:    6.0    1st Qu.:    2.00   1st Qu.:   15.0   \n Mode  :character   Median :   29.0    Median :   15.00   Median :   76.0   \n                    Mean   :  112.3    Mean   :   70.27   Mean   :  295.5   \n                    3rd Qu.:   99.0    3rd Qu.:   63.00   3rd Qu.:  263.0   \n                    Max.   :38287.0    Max.   :24439.00   Max.   :80527.0   \n SRX028961_wild_def\n Min.   :    0.0   \n 1st Qu.:    6.0   \n Median :   37.0   \n Mean   :  173.4   \n 3rd Qu.:  151.0   \n Max.   :58548.0   \n\n\nNotice that:\n\nthe minimum count is 0 and the maximums are very high in all the columns\nthe medians are quite a lot lower than the means so the data are skewed (hump to the left, tail to the right) and there must be quite a lot of zeros\n\nWe want to know how many zeros there are in each a column. To achieve this, we can make use of the fact that TRUE evaluates to 1 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Consequently, summing a column of TRUE/FALSE values will give you the number of TRUE values.

It is most helpful which you have up to about 25 columns. There is nothing special about the number 25, it is just that summaries of a larger number of columns are difficult to grasp.\nüé¨ Get a quick overview of the 7 columns:\n\n# examine all the columns quickly\n# works well with smaller numbers of column\nsummary(pro_meta)\n\n   gene_id             lm_pro_1           lm_pro_2           lm_pro_3       \n Length:8677        Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:    77.0   1st Qu.:    53.0   1st Qu.:    59.0  \n Mode  :character   Median :   191.0   Median :   135.0   Median :   145.0  \n                    Mean   :   364.5   Mean   :   255.7   Mean   :   281.4  \n                    3rd Qu.:   332.0   3rd Qu.:   238.0   3rd Qu.:   256.0  \n                    Max.   :442477.0   Max.   :295423.0   Max.   :411663.0  \n   lm_meta_1          lm_meta_2          lm_meta_3       \n Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0   Min.   :     0.0  \n 1st Qu.:    48.0   1st Qu.:    51.0   1st Qu.:    78.0  \n Median :   110.0   Median :   120.0   Median :   187.0  \n Mean   :   220.3   Mean   :   221.9   Mean   :   355.9  \n 3rd Qu.:   197.0   3rd Qu.:   215.0   3rd Qu.:   341.0  \n Max.   :244569.0   Max.   :205203.0   Max.   :498303.0  \n\n\nNotice that:\n\nthe minimum count is 0 and the maximums are very high in all the columns\nthe medians are quite a lot lower than the means so the data are skewed (hump to the left, tail to the right) and there must be quite a lot of zeros\n\nWe want to know how many zeros there are in each a column. To achieve this, we can make use of the fact that TRUE evaluates to 1 and FALSE evaluates to 0. Consequently, summing a column of TRUE/FALSE values will give you the number of TRUE values. For example, sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0) gives the number of values above zero in the lm_pro_1 column. If you wanted the number of zeros, you could use sum(lm_pro_1 == 0).\nüé¨ Find the number values above zero in all six columns:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  summarise(sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_pro_2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_pro_3 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_1 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_2 &gt; 0),\n            sum(lm_meta_3 &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 1 √ó 6\n  `sum(lm_pro_1 &gt; 0)` `sum(lm_pro_2 &gt; 0)` `sum(lm_pro_3 &gt; 0)`\n                &lt;int&gt;               &lt;int&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n1                8549                8522                8509\n# ‚Ñπ 3 more variables: `sum(lm_meta_1 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;, `sum(lm_meta_2 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;,\n#   `sum(lm_meta_3 &gt; 0)` &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nThere is a better way of doing this that saves you having to repeat so much code - very useful if you have a lot more than 6 columns! We can use pivot_longer() to put the data in tidy format and then use the group_by() and summarise() approach we have used extensively before.\nüé¨ Find the number of zeros in all columns:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 2\n  sample    n_above_zero\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n1 lm_meta_1         8535\n2 lm_meta_2         8535\n3 lm_meta_3         8530\n4 lm_pro_1          8549\n5 lm_pro_2          8522\n6 lm_pro_3          8509\n\n\nYou could expand this code to get get other useful summary information\nüé¨ Summarise all the samples:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  group_by(sample) |&gt;\n  summarise(min = min(count),\n            lowerq = quantile(count, 0.25),\n            mean = mean(count),\n            median = median(count),\n            upperq = quantile(count, 0.75),\n            max = max(count),\n            n_above_zero = sum(count &gt; 0))\n\n# A tibble: 6 √ó 8\n  sample      min lowerq  mean median upperq    max n_above_zero\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 lm_meta_1     0     48  220.    110    197 244569         8535\n2 lm_meta_2     0     51  222.    120    215 205203         8535\n3 lm_meta_3     0     78  356.    187    341 498303         8530\n4 lm_pro_1      0     77  364.    191    332 442477         8549\n5 lm_pro_2      0     53  256.    135    238 295423         8522\n6 lm_pro_3      0     59  281.    145    256 411663         8509\n\n\nThe mean count ranges from 220 to 364. We do not appear to have any outlying (odd) replicates. The potential effect of an odd replicate is reduced statistical power. Major differences in gene expression will still be uncovered. Differences between genes with lower average expression and or more variable expression might be missed. Whether this matters depends on the biological question you are asking.\nüé¨ Save the summary as a dataframe, pro_meta_summary_samp (using assignment).\nWe can also plot the distribution of counts across samples. We have many values (8677) so we are not limited to using geom_histogram(). geom_density() gives us a smooth distribution.\nüé¨ Plot the log10 of the counts + 1 again but this time facet by the sample:\n\npro_meta |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -gene_id,\n               names_to = \"sample\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(log10(count + 1))) +\n  geom_density() +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ sample, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key information to take from these plots is:\n\nthe distributions are roughly similar\nthe peak at zero suggests quite a few counts of 1.\nwe would expect the distribution of counts in each sample to be roughly log normal so that the small rise near the low end, even before the peak at zero, suggests that these lower counts might be anomalies.\n\nWe have found the distribution across samples to be similar to that over all. This is good because it means that the samples are fairly consistent with each other. We can now move on to the next step.\nDistribution of values across the genes\nThere are lots of genes in this dataset therefore we will take a slightly different approach. We would not want to use plot a distribution for each gene in the same way. Will pivot the data to tidy and then summarise the counts for each gene.\nüé¨ Summarise the counts for each gene and save the result as pro_meta_summary_gene. Include the same columns as we had in the by sample summary (pro_meta_summary_samp) and an additional column, total for the total number of counts for each gene.\nüé¨ View the pro_meta_summary_gene dataframe.\nNotice that we have:\n\na lot of genes with counts of zero in every sample\na lot of genes with zero counts in several of the samples\nsome very very low counts.\n\nGenes with very low counts should be filtered out because they are unreliable - or, at the least, uninformative. The goal of our downstream analysis will be to see if there is a significant difference in gene expression between the stages. Since we have only three replicates in each group, having one or two unreliable, missing or zero values, makes such a determination impossible for a particular gene. We will use the total counts (total) and the number of samples with non-zero values (n_above_zero) in this dataframe to filter our genes later.\nAs we have a lot of genes, it is helpful to plot the mean counts with geom_pointrange() to get an overview of the distributions. We will again plot the log of the mean counts. We will also order the genes from lowest to highest mean count.\nüé¨ Plot the logged mean counts for each gene in order of size using geom_pointrange():\n\npro_meta_summary_gene |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gene_id, mean), y = log10(mean))) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = log10(mean - sd), \n                      ymax = log10(mean + sd )),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note the warning is expected since we have zero means).\nYou can see we also have quite a few genes with means less than 1 (log below zero). Note that the variability between genes (average counts between 0 and 349606) is far greater than between samples (average counts from 220 to 364) which is exactly what we would expect to see.\nNow go to Filtering for QC.",

We could save a copy of the stacked data and then plot it, but here, I have just piped the stacked data straight into ggplot(). This helps me avoid cluttering my R environment with temporary objects.\nüé¨ Pivot the counts (stack the columns) so all the counts are in a single column (expr) labelled in cell by the column it came from and pipe into ggplot() to create a histogram:\n\nhspc_prog |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -ensembl_gene_id,\n               names_to = \"cell\",\n               values_to = \"expr\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = expr)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very striking distribution. Is it what we are expecting? Notice we have a peak at zero indicating there are low values zeros. This inflation of low values suggests some are anomalous - they will have been derived from low counts which are likely false positives. As inaccurate measures, we will want to exclude expression values below (about) 1. We will revisit this after we have considered the distribution of expression across cells and genes.\nWhat about the bimodal appearance of the the ‚Äòreal‚Äô values? If we had the whole transcriptome we would not expect to see such a pattern - we‚Äôd expect to see a roughly normal distribution4. However, this is a subset of the genome and the nature of the subsetting has had an influence here. These are a subset of cell surface proteins that show a significant difference between at least two of twelve cell subtypes. That is, all of these genes are either ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúlow‚Äù leading to a bimodal distribution.\nUnlike the other three datasets, which count raw counts, these data are normalised and log2 transformed. We do not need to plot the log of the values to see the distribution - they are already logged.\nDistribution of values across the samples\nFor the other three datasets, we used the summary() function to get an overview of the columns. This works well when you have upto about 25 columns but it is not helpful here because we have a lot of cells! Feel free to try it!\nIn this data set, there is even more of an advantage of using the pivot_longer(), group_by() and summarise() approach. We will be able to open the dataframe in the Viewer and make plots to examine whether the distributions are similar across cells. The mean and the standard deviation are useful to see the distributions across cells in a plot but we will also examine the interquartile values, maximums and the number of non-zero values.\nüé¨ Summarise all the cells:\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell &lt;- hspc_prog |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -ensembl_gene_id,\n               names_to = \"cell\",\n               values_to = \"expr\") |&gt;\n  group_by(cell) |&gt;\n  summarise(min = min(expr),\n            lowerq = quantile(expr, 0.25),\n            sd = sd(expr),\n            mean = mean(expr),\n            median = median(expr),\n            upperq = quantile(expr, 0.75),\n            max = max(expr),\n            total = sum(expr),\n            n_above_zero = sum(expr &gt; 0))\n\nüé¨ View the hspc_prog_summary_cell dataframe (click on it in the environment).\nNotice that: - a minimum value of 0 appears in all 1499 cells - the lower quartiles are all zero and so are many of the medians - there are no cells with above 0 expression in all 280 of the gene subset - the highest number of genes expressed is 208, the lowest is 94\nIn short, there are quite a lot of zeros.\nTo get a better understanding of the distribution of expressions in cells we can create a ggplot using the pointrange geom. Pointrange puts a dot at the mean and a line between a minimum and a maximum such as +/- one standard deviation. Not unlike a boxplot, but when you need the boxes too be very narrow!\nüé¨ Create a pointrange plot.\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = cell, y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd ),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to use the Zoom button to pop the plot window out so you can make it as wide as possible\nThe things to notice are:\n\nthe average expression in cells is similar for all cells. This is good to know - if some cells had much lower expression perhaps there is something wrong with them, or their sequencing, and they should be excluded.\nthe distributions are roughly similar in width too\n\nThe default order of cell is alphabetical. It can be easier to judge if there are unusual cells if we order the lines by the size of the mean.\nüé¨ Order a pointrange plot with reorder(variable_to_order, order_by).\n\nhspc_prog_summary_cell |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(cell, mean), y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd ),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreorder() arranges cell in increasing size of mean\nAs we thought, the distributions are similar across cells - there are not any cells that are obviously different from the others (only incrementally).\nDistribution of values across the genes\nWe will use the same approach to summarise the genes.\nüé¨ Summarise the expression for each gene and save the result as hspc_prog_summary_gene. Include the same columns as we had in the by cell summary (hspc_prog_summary_cell) and an additional column, total for the total expression for each gene.\nüé¨ View the hspc_prog_summary_gene dataframe. Remember these are normalised and logged (base 2) so we should not see very large values.\nNotice that we have:\n\nsome genes (7) expressed in every cell, and many expressed in most cells\nquite a few genes with zero in many cells but this matters less when we have many cells (samples) than when we have few samples.\nno genes with zeros in every cell - the lowest number of cells is 15.\n\nIt is again helpful to plot the ordered mean expression with pointrange to get an overview.\nüé¨ Plot the logged mean counts for each gene in order of size using geom_pointrange():\n\nhspc_prog_summary_gene |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(ensembl_gene_id, mean), y = mean)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, \n                      ymax = mean + sd),\n                  size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the variability between genes (average expression between 0.020 and and 9.567) is far greater than between cells (average expression from 1.319 to 9.567) which is just what we would expect.\nNow go to Filtering for QC.",

In other words unexpressed genes have already been filtered out. However, it is good practices to verify there are no unexpressed genes before we embark on our analysis.\nWhere the sum of all the values in the rows is zero, all the entries must be zero. We can use this to find any the genes that are not expressed in any of the cells. To do row wise aggregates such as the sum across rows we can use the rowwise() function. c_across() allows us to use the colon notation to select columns.

It is useful for viewing large files because it does not load the whole file into memory before displaying it. Instead, it reads and displays a few lines at a time. You can navigate forward through the file with the spacebar, and backwards with the b key.

There is no ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù or undo.\nTo move a file from one directory to another, use the mv command. mv works like cp except that it also deletes the original file.\nmv ../copy_of_1cq2.pdb .\nMake a directory\nmkdir mynewdir"

However, as you start to load more packages, you will want to know if you are using a function from a package that has the same name as a function in another loaded package.

This is useful for the functions you use a lot or ones where you are certain you always want to use a particular function.\nFor example, to always use the dplyr version of filter() by default you can add this to the top of your script:\n\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)\n\nWe will also want to ensure that we are using the setdiff() function from the GenomicRanges package which is used by DESeq2.\n\nconflicts_prefer(GenomicRanges::setdiff)",

Create DESeqDataSet object\nüé¨ Load the DESeq2 package:\nA DEseqDataSet object is a custom data type that is used by DESeq2. Custom data types are common in the Bioconductor1 packages. They are used to store data in a way that is useful for the analysis. These data types typically have data, transformed data, metadata and experimental designs within them.\nTo create a DESeqDataSet object, we need to provide three things:\n\nThe raw counts - these are in s30_filtered\n\nThe meta data which gives information about the samples and which treatment groups they belong to\nA design matrix which captures the design of the statistical model.\n\nThe counts must in a matrix rather than a dataframe. Unlike a dataframe, a matrix has columns of all the same type. That is, it will contain only the counts. The gene ids are given as row names rather than a column. The matrix() function will create a matrix from a dataframe of columns of the same type and the select() function can be used to remove the gene ids column.\nüé¨ Create a matrix of the counts:\n\ns30_count_mat &lt;- s30_filtered |&gt;\n  select(-xenbase_gene_id) |&gt;\n  as.matrix()\n\nüé¨ Add the gene ids as row names to the matrix:\n\n# add the row names to the matrix\nrownames(s30_count_mat) &lt;- s30_filtered$xenbase_gene_id\n\nYou might want to view the matrix (click on it in your environment pane).\nThe metadata are in a file, frog_meta_data.txt. This is a tab-delimited file. The first column is the sample name and the other columns give the ‚Äútreatments‚Äù. In this case, the treatments stage (with three levels) and treatment (with two levels).\nüé¨ Make a folder called meta and save the file to it.\nüé¨ Read the metadata into a dataframe:\n\nmeta &lt;- read_table(\"meta/frog_meta_data.txt\")\n\nüé¨ Examine the resulting dataframe.\nWe need to add the sample names as row names to the metadata dataframe. This is because the DESeqDataSet object will use the row names to match the samples in the metadata to the samples in the counts matrix.\nüé¨ Add the sample names as row names to the metadata dataframe:\n\nmeta &lt;- meta |&gt;\n  column_to_rownames(\"sample_id\")\n\nWe are dealing only with the S30 data so we need to remove the samples that are not in the S30 data.\nüé¨ Filter the metadata to keep only the S30 information:\n\nmeta_s30 &lt;- meta |&gt;\n  filter(stage == \"stage_30\")\n\nWe can now create the DESeqDataSet object. The design formula describes the statistical model. You should recognise the form from previous work. The ~ can be read as ‚Äúexplain by‚Äù and on its right hand side are the explanatory variables. That is, the model is counts explained by treatment and sibling_rep. We are interested in the difference between the treatments but we include sibling_rep to account for the fact that the data are paired. The condition of interest should go at the end of the design formula.\nNote that:\n\nThe names of the columns in the count matrix have to exactly match the names of the rows in the metadata dataframe. They also need to be in the same order.\nThe names of the explanatory variables in the design formula have to match the names of columns in the metadata.\n\nüé¨ Create the DESeqDataSet object:\n\ndds &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = s30_count_mat,\n                              colData = meta_s30,\n                              design = ~ sibling_rep + treatment)\n\nThe warning ‚ÄúWarning: some variables in design formula are characters, converting to factors‚Äù just means that the variable type of treatment and sibling_rep in the metadata dataframe are ‚Äúchar‚Äù and they have been converted into the factors.\nTo help you understand what the DESeqDataSet object we have called dds contains, we can look its contents\nThe counts are in dds@assays@data@listData[[\"counts\"]] and the metadata are in dds@colData but the easiest way to see them is to use the counts() and colData() functions from the DESeq2 package.\nüé¨ View the counts:\n\ncounts(dds) |&gt; View()\n\nYou should be able to see that this is the same as in s30_count_mat.\nüé¨ View the column information:\n\ncolData(dds)\n\nDataFrame with 6 rows and 3 columns\n              stage treatment sibling_rep\n        &lt;character&gt;  &lt;factor&gt;    &lt;factor&gt;\nS30_C_1    stage_30   control       one  \nS30_C_2    stage_30   control       two  \nS30_C_3    stage_30   control       three\nS30_F_1    stage_30   FGF           one  \nS30_F_2    stage_30   FGF           two  \nS30_F_3    stage_30   FGF           three\n\n\nYou should be able to see this is the same as in meta_s30.\n3. Prepare the normalised counts\nThe normalised counts are the counts that have been transformed to account for the library size (i.e., the total number of reads in a sample) and the gene length. We have to first estimate the normalisation factors and store them in the DESeqDataSet object and then we can get the normalised counts.\nüé¨ Estimate the factors for normalisation and store them in the DESeqDataSet object:\n\ndds &lt;- estimateSizeFactors(dds)\n\nüé¨ Look at the factors (just for information):\n\nsizeFactors(dds)\n\n  S30_C_1   S30_C_2   S30_C_3   S30_F_1   S30_F_2   S30_F_3 \n0.8812200 0.9454600 1.2989886 1.0881870 1.0518961 0.8322894 \n\n\nThe normalised counts will be useful to use later. To get the normalised counts we again used the counts() function but this time we use the normalized=TRUE argument.\nüé¨ Save the normalised to a matrix:\n\nnormalised_counts &lt;- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)\n\nüé¨ Make a dataframe of the normalised counts, adding a column for the gene ids at the same time:\n\ns30_normalised_counts &lt;- data.frame(normalised_counts,\n                                    xenbase_gene_id = row.names(normalised_counts))\n\n4. Differential expression analysis\nWe use the DESeq() function to do the differential expression analysis. This function fits the statistical model to the data and then uses the model to calculate the significance of the difference between the treatments. It again stores the results in the DESseqDataSet object. Note that the differential expression needs the raw (unnormalised counts) as it does its own normalisation as part of the process.\nüé¨ Run the differential expression analysis and store the results in the same object:\n\ndds &lt;- DESeq(dds)\n\nThe function will take only a few moments to run on this data but can take longer for bigger datasets.\nWe need to define the contrasts we want to test. We want to test the difference between the treatments so we will define the contrast as FGF and control.\nüé¨ Define the contrast:\n\ncontrast_fgf &lt;- c(\"treatment\", \"FGF\", \"control\")\n\nNote that treatment is the name of the column in the metadata dataframe and FGF and control are the names of the levels in the treatment column. By putting them in the order FGF , control we are saying the fold change will be FGF / control. This means:\n\npositive log fold changes indicate FGF &gt; control and\nnegative log fold changes indicates control &gt; FGF.\n\nIf we had put them in the order control, FGF we would have the reverse.\nüé¨ Extract the results from the DESseqDataSet object:\n\nresults_fgf &lt;- results(dds,\n                       contrast = contrast_fgf)\n\nThis will give us the log2 fold change, the p-value and the adjusted p-value for the comparison between the control and the FGF-treatment for each gene.\nüé¨ Put the results in a dataframe and add the gene ids as a column:\n\ns30_results &lt;- data.frame(results_fgf,\n                          xenbase_gene_id = row.names(results_fgf))\n\nIt is useful to have the normalised counts and the statistical results in one dataframe.\nüé¨ Merge the two dataframes:\n\n# merge the results with the normalised counts\ns30_results &lt;- s30_normalised_counts |&gt;\n  left_join(s30_results, by = \"xenbase_gene_id\")\n\nNow go to Add gene information.",

They also need to be in the same order.\nThe names of the explanatory variables in the design formula have to match the names of columns in the metadata.\n\nüé¨ Create the DESeqDataSet object:\n\ndds &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(pro_meta_count_mat,\n                              colData = meta_pro_meta,\n                              design = ~ stage)\n\nThe warning ‚ÄúWarning: some variables in design formula are characters, converting to factors‚Äù just means that the variable type of stage in the metadata dataframe is ‚Äúchar‚Äù and it has been converted into a factor type.\nTo help you understand what the DESeqDataSet object we have called dds contains, we can look its contents\nThe counts are in dds@assays@data@listData[[\"counts\"]] and the metadata are in dds@colData but the easiest way to see them is to use the counts() and colData() functions from the DESeq2 package.\nüé¨ View the counts:\n\ncounts(dds) |&gt; View()\n\nYou should be able to see that this is the same as in pro_meta_count_mat.\nüé¨ View the column information:\n\ncolData(dds)\n\nDataFrame with 6 rows and 2 columns\n               stage replicate\n            &lt;factor&gt; &lt;numeric&gt;\nlm_pro_1  procyclic          1\nlm_pro_2  procyclic          2\nlm_pro_3  procyclic          3\nlm_meta_1 metacyclic         1\nlm_meta_2 metacyclic         2\nlm_meta_3 metacyclic         3\n\n\nYou should be able to see this is the same as in meta_pro_meta.\n3. Prepare the normalised counts\nThe normalised counts are the counts that have been transformed to account for the library size (i.e., the total number of reads in a sample) and the gene length. We have to first estimate the normalisation factors and store them in the DESeqDataSet object and then we can get the normalised counts.\nüé¨ Estimate the factors for normalisation and store them in the DESeqDataSet object:\n\ndds &lt;- estimateSizeFactors(dds)\n\nüé¨ Look at the factors (just for information):\n\nsizeFactors(dds)\n\n lm_pro_1  lm_pro_2  lm_pro_3 lm_meta_1 lm_meta_2 lm_meta_3 \n1.3029351 0.9158157 0.9943186 0.7849299 0.8443586 1.3250409 \n\n\nThe normalised counts will be useful to use later. To get the normalised counts we again used the counts() function but this time we use the normalized=TRUE argument.\nüé¨ Save the normalised to a matrix:\n\nnormalised_counts &lt;- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)\n\nüé¨ Make a dataframe of the normalised counts, adding a column for the gene ids at the same time:\n\npro_meta_normalised_counts &lt;- data.frame(normalised_counts,\n                                    gene_id = row.names(normalised_counts))\n\n4. Differential expression analysis\nWe use the DESeq() function to do the differential expression analysis. This function fits the statistical model to the data and then uses the model to calculate the significance of the difference between the treatments. It again stores the results in the DESseqDataSet object. Note that the differential expression needs the raw (unnormalised counts) as it does its own normalisation as part of the process.\nüé¨ Run the differential expression analysis and store the results in the same object:\n\ndds &lt;- DESeq(dds)\n\nThe function will take only a few moments to run on this data but can take longer for bigger datasets.\nWe need to define the contrasts we want to test. We want to test the difference between the treatments so we will define the contrast as procyclic and metacyclic.\nüé¨ Define the contrast:\n\ncontrast_pro_meta &lt;- c(\"stage\", \"procyclic\", \"metacyclic\")\n\nNote that stage is the name of the column in the metadata dataframe and procyclic and metacyclic are the names of the levels in the stage column. By putting them in the order procyclic , metacyclic we are saying the fold change will be procyclic / metacyclic. This means:\n\npositive log fold changes indicate procyclic &gt; metacyclic and\nnegative log fold changes indicates metacyclic &gt; procyclic.\n\nIf we had put them in the order metacyclic, procyclic we would have the reverse.\nüé¨ Extract the results from the DESseqDataSet object:\n\nresults_pro_meta &lt;- results(dds,\n                       contrast = contrast_pro_meta)\n\nThis will give us the log2 fold change, the p-value and the adjusted p-value for the comparison between procyclic and metacyclic stage for each gene\nüé¨ Put the results in a dataframe and add the gene ids as a column:\n\npro_meta_results &lt;- data.frame(results_pro_meta,\n                          gene_id = row.names(results_pro_meta))\n\nIt is useful to have the normalised counts and the statistical results in one dataframe.\nüé¨ Merge the two dataframes:\n\n# merge the results with the normalised counts\npro_meta_results &lt;- pro_meta_normalised_counts |&gt;\n  left_join(pro_meta_results, by = \"gene_id\")\n\nNow go to Add gene information.",

This needs to be done on the logged normalised counts.\n\n1. Genes expressed in one cell type\nThe genes expressed in only cell type are those with zeros in all the cells of the other type. We can find these by summing the expression values for each gene across the cells of one type and filtering for those that are zero.\nTo do row wise aggregates such as the sum across rows we can use the rowwise() function. c_across() allows us to use the colon notation to select columns. This is very useful when you have a lot of columns because it would be annoying to have to list all of them. HSPC_001:HSPC_852 means all the columns from HSPC_001 to HSPC_852.\nüé¨ Find the genes expressed only in progenitor cells (i.e., those that are 0 in every HSPC cell):\n\nhspc_prog |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  filter(sum(c_across(HSPC_001:HSPC_852)) == 0)\n\n# A tibble: 0 √ó 1,500\n# Rowwise: \n# ‚Ñπ 1,500 variables: ensembl_gene_id &lt;chr&gt;, HSPC_001 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_002 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_003 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_004 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_006 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_008 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_009 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_011 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_012 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_014 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_015 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_016 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_017 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_018 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_020 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_021 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_022 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_023 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_024 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_025 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_026 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_027 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   HSPC_028 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_030 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_031 &lt;dbl&gt;, HSPC_033 &lt;dbl&gt;, ‚Ä¶\n\n\nWe already know from last week‚Äôs work that there are no genes that are zero across all the cells (both types).

Prepare the data for analysis with scran\n\nscran can use a matrix or a dataframe of counts but these must be log normalised counts. If using a dataframe, the columns must only contain the expression values (not the gene ids). The rows can be named to retain the gene ids.\nhspc_prog is a dataframe so we will use the ensembl gene ids to name the rows and remove the gene ids from the dataframe.\nüé¨ Add the gene ids as the row names:\n\nhspc_prog &lt;- hspc_prog |&gt;\n  column_to_rownames(\"ensembl_gene_id\")\n\nLike DESeq2, scran needs metadata to define which columns were in which group. Instead of having this is a file, we will create a vector that indicates which column belongs to which cell type.\nüé¨ Create a vector that indicates which column belongs to which cell type:\n\nn_hspc &lt;- 701\nn_prog &lt;- 798\n\ncell_type &lt;- rep(c(\"hspc\",\"prog\"), \n                 times = c(n_hspc, n_prog))\n\nThe number of times each cell type is repeated is the number of cells of that type. Do check that the length of the cell_type vector is the same as the number of columns in the hspc_prog dataframe.\n3. Differential expression analysis\nüé¨ Load the scran package:\nDifferential expression is carried out with the findMarkers() function. It takes two arguments. The first argument is the dataframe containing the data and the second argument is the vector indicating which columns are in which cell type. Make sure that the order of the cell types in the vector is appropriate for the order of the columns in the dataframe.\nüé¨ Run the differential expression analysis:\n\nresults_hspc_prog &lt;- findMarkers(hspc_prog, \n                             cell_type)\n\nThe output is a list object which, rather unnecessarily, includes two dataframes. This is not really necessary as the results are the same except for the fold change having a different sign.\n\n\nThe dataframe results_hspc_prog$prog is log prog - log hspc (i.e.,Prog/HSPC).

It does not matter which one you use but you do need keep the direction of the foldchange in mind when interpreting the results.\nNotice that the dataframes are ordered by significance rather than the original gene order.\nIt is useful to have the normalised counts and the statistical results in one dataframe to which we will add the gene information from Ensembl.

We also retrieve the gene id so we can later join the information with the results:\n\ngene_info &lt;- getBM(filters = \"ensembl_gene_id\",\n                   attributes = c(\"ensembl_gene_id\",\n                                  \"external_gene_name\",\n                                  \"description\"),\n                   values = hspc_prog_results$ensembl_gene_id,\n                   mart = ensembl)\n\nYou should view the resulting dataframe to see what information is available. You can use glimpse() or View(). Notice the dataframe returned only has 279 rows - one of the ids does not have information.\nüé¨ Merge the gene information with the results:\n\n# join the gene info with the results\nhspc_prog_results &lt;- hspc_prog_results |&gt; \n  left_join(gene_info, by = \"ensembl_gene_id\")\n\nError in `left_join()`:\n! Can't join `x$ensembl_gene_id` with `y$ensembl_gene_id` due to\n  incompatible types.\n‚Ñπ `x$ensembl_gene_id` is a &lt;character&gt;.\n‚Ñπ `y$ensembl_gene_id` is a &lt;logical&gt;.\n\n\nüé¨ Save the results to a file:\n\nwrite_csv(hspc_prog_results, file = \"results/hspc_prog_results.csv\")",
