# Overview

You are *either*

-   an integrated masters student doing BIO00088H Group Research Project *or*
-   an MSc Bioinformatics student doing BIO00070M Research, Professional and Team Skills

For students doing BIO00088H, Data Analysis compromises six workshops covering computational skills needed in your project. Three of these are core and taken by everyone and three are specific to your project type. MSc Bioinformatics students do the Core workshops and the 'omics workshops as part of BIO00070M.

The project types are:

| Project                                 | Data Strand                     |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Stem Cells, Jillian Barlow              | 'omics, Emma Rand               |
| Developmental Biology, Betsy Pownal     | 'omics, Emma Rand               |
| Microbial Ecology, Kelly Redeker        | 'omics, Emma Rand               |
| Structural Biochemistry, Michael Plevin | molecular-structure, Jon Agirre |
| Neuroscience, Sean Sweeney              | image-analysis, Richard Bingham |
| xxxxxxxxxxxx, Richard Maguire           | image-analysis, Richard Bingham |

The data analysis workshops are:

| Week | Data Strand                                          |
|------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Core 1 Organising reproducible data analyses         |
| 2    | Core 2 File types, workflow tips and other tools     |
| 3    | omics/structure/images 1                             |
| 4    | omics/structure/images 2                             |
| 5    | omics/structure/images 3                             |
| 6    | Drop-in                                              |
| 6    | Core 3 Research Compendia and Reproducible Reporting |
