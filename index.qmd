# Overview

Data Analysis for the Group Research Project (BIO00088H) compromises six workshops covering computational skills needed in your project. Three of these are core and taken by everyone and three are specific to your project type.

The project types are:

| Project                                 | Data Strand                     |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Stem Cells, Jillian Barlow              | 'omics, Emma Rand               |
| Developmental Biology, Betsy Pownal     | 'omics, Emma Rand               |
| Microbial Ecology, Kelly Redeker        | 'omics, Emma Rand               |
| Structural Biochemistry, Michael Plevin | molecular-structure, Jon Agirre |
| Neuroscience, Sean Sweeney              | image-analysis, Richard Bingham |
| xxxxxxxxxxxx, Richard Maguire           | image-analysis, Richard Bingham |

The data analysis workshops are:

|--------|--------------------------|
| Week 1 | Core 1                   |
| Week 2 | Core 2                   |
| Week 3 | omics/structure/images 1 |
| Week 4 | omics/structure/images 2 |
| Week 5 | omics/structure/images 3 |
| Week 6 | Core 3                   |
