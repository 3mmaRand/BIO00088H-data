# Introduction

## Literate Programming

-   Literate programming is a way of writing code and text together in a single document

-   The document is then processed to produce a report

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (recommended) or [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) 


## Session overview

In this workshop we will go through an example quarto document. You will learn:

-   formatting (bold, italics, headings)
-   chunk options to control whether code and output are in the rendered document
-   adding citations
-   figures and tables with cross referencing and autonumberiung
-   inline coding to report results
-   special characters and equations

# Exercise

ðŸŽ¬ make a start on your compendium

ðŸŽ¬ make a start on a quarto doc

# Independent study following the workshop

[Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

# The Code file

These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not visible on the webpage.

The [workshop.qmd](workshop.qmd) file is the file I use to compile the practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary text to be interleaved to produce well-formatted reports including webpages. Right-click on the link and choose Save-As to download. You will be able to open the Qmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/BIO00088H-data/core/week-11/workshop.qmd). Coding and thinking answers are marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

Pages made with R [@R-core], Quarto [@allaire2022], `knitr` [@knitr], `kableExtra` [@kableExtra]
