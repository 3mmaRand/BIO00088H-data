This week we will cover the "Research compendium" which is part of the assessment. A research compendium can be a single RStudio Project but we have broadened the definition. It is a documented collection of all the digital parts of the research project including data (or access to data), code and outputs. The collection is organised and documented in such a way that reproducing all the results is straightforward for another individual.

### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   explain what a research compendium is and describe its components
-   relate the content and concepts in Core 1 and Core 2 to the
    research compendium
-   Create a quarto document and:
    -   appreciate the role of the YAML header 
    -   format text as bold, italics, headings etc
    -   add citations and a bibliography
    -   create automatically numbered figures and tables with cross references in text
    -   set default code chunk behaviour and those for individual chunks 
    -   use inline code to report results
    -   insert special characters and mathematical expressions with LaTeX
