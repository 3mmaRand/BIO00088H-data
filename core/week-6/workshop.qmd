# Introduction

## Session overview

Use this session to ask any questions about [Core 1 Organising
reproducible data analyses](../week-1/overview.qmd) and [Core 2 File
types, workflow tips and other tools](../week-2/overview.qmd) in
particular, or about R and RStudio in general. We will also try to
answer any questions about the 'mics, Image and Structure strands.

You might also review Stage 1 and 2 content to see if there are areas
you might benefit from revisiting. You can access these through the past
VLE sites but you might find it helpful to use the latest versions
because there is no 2FA and the resources are searchable.

Stage 1

-   [Data Analysis in R for Becoming a Bioscientist
    1](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs1/r4babs1.html).Core
    concepts about scientific computing, types of variable, the role of
    variables in analysis and how to use RStudio to organise analysis
    and import, summarise and plot data.

-   [Data Analysis in R for Becoming a Bioscientist
    2](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/r4babs2/r4babs2.html). The
    logic of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, what is meant by
    a statistical model, two-sample tests and one- and two-way analysis
    of variance (ANOVA).

Stage 2

-   [Get Introductory Statistical Tests as Linear models: A guide for R
    users](https://3mmarand.github.io/gist-lm/)

-   [A simple introduction to GLM for analysing Poisson and Binomial
    responses in R](https://3mmarand.github.io/singlm/)
