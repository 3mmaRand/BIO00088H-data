# Introduction

## Session overview

In this workshop 



# Documentation

## Readme files

READMEs are a form of documentation which have been widely used for a
long time. They contain all the information about the other files in a
directory. They can be extensive but need not be. Concise is good.
Bullet points are good

-   Give a project title and description, brief

-   start date, last updated date and contact information

-   Outline the folder structure

-   Give software requirements: programs and versions used or required.
    There are packages that give session information in R @sessioninfo
    and Python @ostblomjoel2019

R:

`sessioninfo::session_info()`

Python:

`import session_info`

`session_info.show()`

-   Instructions run the code, build reports, and reproduce the figures
    etc

-   Where to find the data, outputs

-   Any other information that needed to understand and recreate the
    work

-   Ideally, a summary of changes with the date



## Code comments

-   Comments are notes in the code which are not executed. They are
    ignored by the computer but are read by humans. They are used to
    explain what the code is doing and why. They are also used to
    temporarily remove code from execution.
