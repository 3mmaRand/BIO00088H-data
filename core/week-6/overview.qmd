We considered how to organise reproducible data analyses in 
[Core: Supporting Information 1](../week-2/overview.qmd). This week we will 
consider how to document and curate reproducible data analyses. You will 
add a README to your project and discover all the software you are using in R. 
The workshop will also include a questions and answers section.
