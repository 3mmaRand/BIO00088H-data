1.  ðŸ“– Read  [Understanding file systems](https://3mmarand.github.io/comp4biosci/file_systems.html). This is an approximately 15 - 20 minute read revising file types and filesystems. It covers concepts of working directories and paths. We learned these ideas in stage 1 and you may feel completely confident with them but many students will benefit from a refresher. For BIO00070M students, this is part of the work you will also be asked to complete for BIO00052M Data Analysis in R.

2.  In previous years you have submitted and RStudio Project as part of your BABS work. In this module you will develop this by submitting a Research Compendium. A Research Compendium is a documented collection of all the digital parts of the research project including data (or access to data), code and outputs. The Compendium might be a single Quarto/RStudio Project, (like you have done previously but with better documentation) or it might be a folder including an Quarto/RStudio Project and other material/scripts including the description of unscripted processing. You might want to remind yourself of the example RStudio Project, [Y12345678.zip](Y12345678.zip) used in BABS 2.
