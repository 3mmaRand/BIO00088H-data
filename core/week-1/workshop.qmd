# What is reproducibility?

-   **Reproducible: Same data + same analysis = identical results**. *"... obtaining consistent results using the same input
data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of
analysis. This definition is synonymous with "computational
reproducibility"* [@nationalacademiesofsciences2019]

-   Replicable: Different data + same analysis = qualitatively similar
    results. The work is not dependent on the specificities of the data.

-   Robust: Same data + different analysis = qualitatively similar or
    identical results. The work is not dependent on the specificities of
    the analysis.

-   Generalisable: Different data + different analysis = qualitatively
    similar results and same conclusions. The findings can be
    generalised

# Project organisation

## Project oriented workflow

-  Readme
-  folders, files 

## Naming things 

 

## File formats

Data files.
-   Sequences data 
-   Image data 
-   Structure data

Similarities and differences 

## Tidy data reminder

You're finished!

# ðŸ¥³ Well Done! ðŸŽ‰

# Independent study following the workshop

[Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

# The Code file

These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not
visible on the webpage.

The [workshop.qmd](workshop.qmd) file is the file I use to compile the
practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary
text to be interleaved to produce well-formatted reports including
webpages. Right-click on the link and choose Save-As to download. You
will be able to open the Qmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in
Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/). Coding and thinking answers are
marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

Pages made with R [@R-core], Quarto [@allaire2022], `knitr` [@knitr],
