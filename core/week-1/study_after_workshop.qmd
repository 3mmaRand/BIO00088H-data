These are suggestions

## BIO00088H Group Research Project students

1.  Revise previous Data Analysis materials. You can find the version you took on the VLE site for 17C or 08C. However, my latest versions (in development) are here: [Data Analysis in R](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/). The Becoming a Bioscientist (BABS) modules replace the Laboratory and Professional Skills modules. BABS1 and BABS1 are stage one, and I've tried to improve them over 17C and 08C. The site is also searchable (icon top right)

## MSc Bioinformatics students doing BIO00070M

1.  Make sure you carry out the [preparatory work for week 2 of 52M](https://3mmarand.github.io/R4BABS/pgt52m/week-2/overview.html)
