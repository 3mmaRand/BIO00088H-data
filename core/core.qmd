# Content
There are three workshops taken by everyone on BIO00088H and BIO00070M. These are in weeks 1, 2 and 6. The first two cover some useful workflow tips and how to organise your analyses effectively so they are reproducible but you will also have the chance to revise material from stage 1 and 2.

Good organisation is important because you will want to be able to set work aside for holidays and assessment periods and then restart easily. You will also be assessed on the organisation, reproducibility and transparency of your work. 

## Week 1 Core 1 Organising reproducible data analyses

This week you will revise some essential concepts for scientific computing: file system organisation, file types, working directories and paths. The workshop will cover a rationale for working reproducibly, project oriented workflow, naming things and documenting your work. We will also examine some file types and the concept of tidy data.
