There are two workshops taken by everyone on BIO00088H. These are in
weeks 2 and 6. These are important in understanding both how to
assemble, curate and document your "Supporting Information" and how to

work with past you and your work is demonstrably repeatable. This is
essential because you will want to be able to set work aside for
holidays and assessment periods and then restart easily. The Supporting
Information you submit with your Report will be be assessed on its
organisation, reproducibility and documentation.
