Similarities and differences

## Getting started

Make a new RStudio project (use the workflow from in the independent
study

Tips

# The command line

The command line - or shell - is a text interface for your computer.
It's a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the
computer's operating system to run.

## RStudio terminal

The RStudio terminal is a convenient interface to the shell without
leaving RStudio. It is useful for running commands that are not
available in R. For example, you can use it to run other programs like
fasqc, git, ftp, ssh

```{bash}
pwd
```

```{bash}
ls
```

```{bash}
ls -l
```

```{bash}
ls -F
```

# Independent study following the workshop

[Consolidate](study_after_workshop.qmd)

# The Code file

These contain all the code needed in the workshop even where it is not
visible on the webpage.

The [workshop.qmd](workshop.qmd) file is the file I use to compile the
practical. Qmd stands for Quarto markdown. It allows code and ordinary
text to be interleaved to produce well-formatted reports including
webpages. Right-click on the link and choose Save-As to download. You
will be able to open the Qmd file in RStudio. Alternatively, [View in
Browser](https://github.com/3mmaRand/). Coding and thinking answers are
marked with `#---CODING ANSWER---` and `#---THINKING ANSWER---`

Pages made with R [@R-core], Quarto [@allaire2022], `knitr` [@knitr],
