# Introduction

## Session overview

In this workshop we will discuss why reproducibility matters and how to
organise your work to make it reproducible. We will cover:

# Reproducibility

## What is reproducibility?

-   **Reproducible: Same data + same analysis = identical results**.
    *"... obtaining consistent results using the same input data;
    computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis.
    This definition is synonymous with"computational reproducibility"*
    [@nationalacademiesofsciences2019]

-   Replicable: Different data + same analysis = qualitatively similar
    results. The work is not dependent on the specificities of the data.

-   Robust: Same data + different analysis = qualitatively similar or
    identical results. The work is not dependent on the specificities of
    the analysis.

-   Generalisable: Different data + different analysis = qualitatively
    similar results and same conclusions. The findings can be
    generalised

Each of cells contain one of the definitions for reproducibility"}](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#rr-overview-definitions)

## Why does it matter?

-   Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly [@markowetz2015].
    Alternatively, see the very entertaining
    [talk](https://youtu.be/yVT07Sukv9Q)

-   Many high profile cases of work which did not reproduce e.g. Anil
    Potti unravelled by @baggerly2009

-   **Will** become standard in Science and publishing e.g OECD Global
    Science Forum Building digital workforce capacity and skills for
    data-intensive science [@oecdglobalscienceforum2020]

## How to achieve reproducibility

-   Scripting

-   Organisation: Project-oriented workflows with file and folder
    structure, naming things

-   Documentation: Readme files, code comments, metadata, version
    control

# Scripting

## Rationale for scripting?

-   Science is the generation of ideas, designing work to test them and
    reporting the results.

-   We ensure laboratory and field work is replicable, robust and
    generalisable by planning and recording in lab books and using
    standard protocols. Repeating results is still hard.

-   Workflows for computational projects, and the data analysis and
    reporting of other work can, and should, be 100% reproducible!

-   Scripting is the way to achieve this.

# Organisation

## Project-oriented workflow

-   use folders to organise your work

-   you are aiming for structured, systematic and repeatable.

-   inputs and outputs should be clearly identifiable from structure
    and/or naming

Examples

```         
-- liver_transcriptome/
   |__data
      |__raw/
      |__processed/
   |__images/
   |__code/
   |__reports/
   |__figures/
```


add an example which is an RSP and one which includes an RSP

## Reproducibility is a continuum

Some is better than none!

-   Organise your project   
-   Script **everything**.  
-   Format code and follow a consistent style.  
-   Code algorithmically 
-   Modularise your code: organise into sections and scripts 
-   Document your project - commenting, READMEs 


# RStudio Projects revisited

## RStudio Projects

::: incremental

-   RStudio Projects make it easy to manage working directories and
    paths because they set the working directory to the RStudio Projects
    directory automatically.
:::

## RStudio Projects

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
-- stem_cell_rna
   |__stem_cell_rna.Rproj

         |__normalise.R
```
:::

The project directory is the folder at the top [^1]

    Note to futureself: the `engine: knitr` matters.

```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
the `.RProj` file is directly under the project folder. Its presence is what makes the folder an RStudio Project
:::
:::

## RStudio Projects

::: incremental
-   When you open an RStudio Project, the working directory is set to
    the Project directory (i.e., the location of the `.Rproj` file).

-   When you use an RStudio Project you do not need to use `setwd()`

-   When someone, including future you, opens the project on another
    machine, all the paths just work.

## RStudio Projects

![Jenny Bryan](images/JennyBryan.jpg){fig-align="left" width="400"}

In the words of [Jenny
Bryan](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/):

> "If the first line of your R script is
> setwd("C:/Users/jenny/path/that/only/I/have") I will come into your
> office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE"

## Creating an RStudio Project

There are two menus options:

1.  Top left, File menu

2.  Top Right, drop-down indicated by the `.RProj` icon

They both do the same thing. 

In both cases you choose: New Project \| New Directory \| New Project

Make sure you "Browse" to the folder you want to create the project.


❔ Is your working directory a good place to create a Project folder?


When you create a new RStudio Project 

::: incremental

-   A folder called `bananas/` is created
-   RStudio starts a new session in `bananas/` i.e., your working
    directory is now `bananas/`
-   A file called `bananas.Rproj` is created
-   the `.Rproj` file is what makes the directory an RStudio Project
:::


## Opening and closing

You can close an RStudio Project with ONE of:

1.  File \| Close Project
2.  Using the drop-down option on the far right of the tool bar where
    you see the Project name

. . .

You can open an RStudio Project with ONE of:

1.  File \| Open Project or File \| Recent Projects\
2.  Using the drop-down option on the far right of the tool bar where
    you see the Project name\
3.  Double-clicking an .Rproj file from your file explorer/finder

When you open project, a new R session starts.



#  Code formatting and style


##  Code formatting and style

> "Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."

[The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) 

##  Code formatting and style

We have all written code which is hard to read! 

We all improve over time.

```{r}
#| echo: false
tweetrmd::include_tweet("https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/589068687669243905")
```



##  Code formatting and style

Some keys points:

-   be consistent, emulate experienced coders  
-   use snake_case for variable names (not CamelCase, dot.case)  
-   use `<-` not `=` for assignment  
-   use spacing around most operators and after commas  
-   use indentation  
-   avoid long lines, break up code blocks with new lines  
-   use `"` for quoting text (not `'`) unless the text contains double quotes  



## 😩 Ugly code 😩



```{r}
#| eval: false
data<-read_csv('../data-raw/Y101_Y102_Y201_Y202_Y101-5.csv',skip=2)
library(janitor);sol<-clean_names(data)
data=data|>filter(str_detect(description,"OS=Homo sapiens"))|>filter(x1pep=='x')
data=data|>
mutate(g=str_extract(description,
"GN=[^\\s]+")|>str_replace("GN=",''))
data<-data|>mutate(id=str_extract(accession,"1::[^;]+")|>str_replace("1::",""))
```


## 😩 Ugly code 😩

-   no spacing or indentation
-   inconsistent splitting of code blocks over lines
-   inconsistent use of quote characters
-   no comments
-   variable names convey no meaning
-   use of `=` for assignment and inconsistently
-   multiple commands on a line
-   library statement in the middle of the analysis



## 😎 Cool code 😎


```{r}
#| eval: false

# Packages ----------------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# Import ------------------------------------------------------------------

# define file name
file <- "../data-raw/Y101_Y102_Y201_Y202_Y101-5.csv"

# import: column headers and data are from row 3
solu_protein <- read_csv(file, skip = 2) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

# Tidy data ----------------------------------------------------------------

# filter out the bovine proteins and those proteins 
# identified from fewer than 2 peptides
solu_protein <- solu_protein |>
  filter(str_detect(description, "OS=Homo sapiens")) |>
  filter(x1pep == "x")

# Extract the genename from description column to a column
# of its own
solu_protein <- solu_protein |>
  mutate(genename =  str_extract(description,"GN=[^\\s]+") |>
           str_replace("GN=", ""))

# Extract the top protein identifier from accession column (first
# Uniprot ID after "1::") to a column of its own
solu_protein <- solu_protein |>
  mutate(protid =  str_extract(accession, "1::[^;]+") |>
           str_replace("1::", ""))
```


## 😎 Cool code 😎

-   `library()` calls collected

-   Uses code sections to make it easier to navigate

-   Uses white space and proper indentation

-   Commented

-   Uses more informative name for the dataframe



# Code 'algorithmically'


##  Code 'algorithmically'

::: incremental

-   Write code which expresses the structure of the problem/solution.

-   Avoid hard coding numbers if at all possible - declare variables instead

-   Declare frequently used values as variables at the start e.g., colour schemes, figure saving settings

:::

## 😩 Hard coding numbers.

::: incremental

-   Suppose we want to calculate the sums of squares, $SS(x)$, for the number of eggs in five nests. 

-   The formula is given by: $\sum (x_i- \bar{x})^2$  

-   We could calculate the mean and copy it, and the individual numbers into the formula

:::

## 😩 Hard coding numbers.

```{r}
# mean number of eggs per nest
sum(3, 5, 6, 7, 8) / 5

# ss(x) of number of eggs
(3 - 5.8)^2 + (5 - 5.8)^2 + (6 - 5.8)^2 + (7 - 5.8)^2 + (8 - 5.8)^2
```


I am coding the calculation of the mean rather using the `mean()` function only to explain what 'coding algorithmically' means using a simple example.


## 😩 Hard coding numbers

::: incremental

-   if any of the sample numbers must be altered, all the code needs changing

-   it is hard to tell that the output of the first line is a mean

-   its hard to recognise that the numbers in the mean calculation correspond to those in the next calculation

-   it is hard to tell that 5 is just the number of nests

-   no way of know if numbers are the same by coincidence or they refer to the same thing

:::

## 😎 Better

```{r}
# eggs each nest
eggs <- c(3, 5, 6, 7, 8)

# mean eggs per nest
mean_eggs <- sum(eggs) / length(eggs)

# ss(x) of number of eggs
sum((eggs - mean_eggs)^2)
```

## 😎 Better

::: incremental

-   the commenting is similar but it is easier to follow

-   if any of the sample numbers must be altered, only that number needs changing

-   assigning a value you will later use to a variable with a meaningful name allows us to understand the first and second calculations

-   makes use of R's elementwise calculation which resembles the formula (i.e., is expressed as the general rule)

:::

## Summary

::: incremental

-  Use an RStudio project for any R work (you can also incorporate other languages)

-  Write Cool code not Ugly code: space, consistency, indentation, comments, meaningful variable names

-  Write code which expresses the structure of the problem/solution.

-  Avoid hard coding numbers if at all possible - declare variables instead

## Naming things

![documents, CC-BY-NC,
https://xkcd.com/1459/](images/xkcd-comic-file-names.png){fig-alt="A comic figure is looking over the shoulder of another and is shocked by a list of files with names like 'Untitled 138 copy.docx' and 'Untitled 243.doc'. Caption: 'Protip: Never look in someone else's documents folder'"}

Guiding principle - Have a convention! Good file names are:

-   machine readable

-   human readable

-   play nicely with sorting

I suggest

-   no spaces in names

-   use snake_case or kebab-case rather than CamelCase or dot.case

-   use all lower case except very occasionally where convention is
    otherwise, e.g., README, LICENSE

-   ordering: use left-padded numbers e.g., 01, 02....99 or 001,
    002....999

-   dates [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:
    2020-10-16

-   write down your conventions
