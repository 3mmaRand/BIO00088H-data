This week you will revise some essential concepts for scientific computing: 
file system organisation, file types, working directories and paths. You will
also ensure you know how to use the virtual desktop service (VDS) to access
the software you need for your work.
The workshop will cover a rationale for working reproducibly, 
project oriented workflow, naming things and documenting your work. 


### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   explain the organisation of files and directories in a file 
    systems including root, home and working directories
-   explain absolute and relative file paths
-   explain why working reproducibly is important
-   know how to use a project-oriented workflow to organise work
-   be able to give files human- and machine-readable names
-   write cool 😎 code not 😩 ugly code
-   explain the value of code which expresses the structure of the 
    problem/solution.
-   use some useful shortcuts to help write cool 😎 code
-   ensure they can use the VDS to access files and software
    required for the work
