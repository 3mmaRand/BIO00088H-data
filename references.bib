  title    = "Tidy Data",
  author   = "Wickham, Hadley",
  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",

  abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

Some principles of design will be presented followed by discussion of their application using three case studies. There will also be an opportunity for participants to discuss their own designs. This module assumes no experience with designing omics’ experiments but some previous experience experimental design and statistical analysis - such as would be covered in an undergraduate bioscience degreee - would be useful.
