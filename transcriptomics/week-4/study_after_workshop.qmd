You need only do the section for your own project data

🐸 Frogs

🎬 Open your `frogs-88H` Project and script you began in the Consolidation study last week. This is likely to be `cont-fgf-s20.R` or `cont-fgf-s14.R`. Use the differential expression analysis you did in the workshop (in `cont-fgf-s30.R`) as a template to continue your script. 

🐭 Mice

🎬 Open your `mice-88H` Project. Make a new script and, using `hspc-prog.R` as a template, repeat the analysis on a different comparisons.
