You need only do the section for your own project data

🎄 *Arabidopsis*

🎬 Open your `arab-88H` RStudio Project and the `cont-low-aerial.R`
script you began in the Consolidation study last week. Use the
differential expression analysis you did in the workshop (in
`cont-low-root.R`) as a template to continue your script.

💉 *Leishmania*

🎬 Open your `leish-88H` RStudio Project and the `pro_ama.R` script you
began in the Consolidation study last week. Use the differential
expression analysis you did in the workshop (in `pro_meta.R`) as a
template to continue your script.

🐭 Stem cells

🎬 Open your `mice-88H` RStudio Project and the `hspc-lthsc.R` script
you began in the Consolidation study last week. Use the differential
expression analysis you did in the workshop (in `hspc-prog.R`) as a
template to continue your script.
