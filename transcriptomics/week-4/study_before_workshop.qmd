# Where should you be?

## What we did in Transcriptomics 1: 👋 Hello data!

::: incremental
::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   Discovered how many rows and columns we had in our datasets and what
    these were.
-   Examined the distribution of values
    -   across the whole dataset
    -   across the samples/cells (i.e., averaged over genes)
        to see variation between samples/cells
    -   across the genes (i.e., averaged over samples/cells)
        to see variation between genes
-   Saved files of filtered data.

# Differential expression

## Differential expression

::: incremental
-   The goal of differential expression is to test whether there is a
    significant difference in gene expression between groups.

-   A large number of computational methods have been developed for
    differential expression analysis

-   R is the leading language for differential expression analysis
:::

## Differential expression

::: incremental
-   the statistical concepts are very similar to those you have already
    encountered in stages 1 and 2

-   you are essentially doing paired- or independent-samples tests

-   but you are doing a lot of them! One for every gene

-   data need normalisation before comparison
:::

## Statistical concepts

Like familiar tests:

::: incremental
-   the type of test (the function) you use depends on the type of data
    you have and the type of assumptions you want to make

-   the tests work by comparing the variation between groups to the
    variation within groups.

-   you will get: the difference between groups, a test statistic, and a
    *p*-value

-   you also get an **adjusted *p*-value** which is the 'correction' for
    multiple testing
:::

## The difference between groups

::: incremental
-   The difference between groups is given as the log~2~ fold change in
    expression between groups

-   A fold change is the expression in one group divided by the
    expression in the other group

-   we use fold changes because the absolute expression values may not
    be accurate and relative changes are what matters

-   we use log~2~ fold changes because they are symmetrical around 0
:::

## Why log~2~ fold change?

::: incremental
-   log~2~ means log to the base 2

-   Suppose the expression in group A is 5 and the expression in group B
    is 8

-   $\frac{A}{B} = \frac{5}{8}$ = 0.625 and $\frac{B}{A} = \frac{8}{5}$ = 1.6

-   If B > A the range of $\frac{A}{B}$ is 0 - 1 but the range of
    $\frac{B}{A}$ is 1 - $\infty$

-   However, if we take the log~2~ of $\frac{A}{B}$ we get -0.678 and the log~2~
    of $\frac{B}{A}$ is 0.678.
:::

## Adjusted *p*-value

::: incremental
-   The *p*-value has to be adjusted because of the number of tested
    being done

-   In stage 1, we used Tukey's HSD to adjust for multiple testing
    following an ANOVA

-   Here the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [@benjamini1995] is used to
    adjust for multiple testing

-   BH controls the [False Discovery
    Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate) (FDR)

-   The FDR is the proportion of false positives among the genes called
    significant
:::

## Normalisation

::: incremental
-   Normalisation adjusts raw counts to account for factors that prevent
    direct comparisons

-   Normalisation usually influences the experimental design as well as
    the analysis

## Normalisation

-   🐭 mice data are normalised 

-   🐸 frog, 🎄 Arabidopisis and 💉 Leishmania data are raw counts 
    (not normalised) because the differential expression method will do this.

-   Normalisation is a big topic. See @düren2022; @bullard2010;
    @lytal2020; @abrams2019; @vallejos2017; @evans2017
:::

## Type of DE tests

::: incremental
-   A large number of computational methods have been developed for
    differential expression analysis

-   Methods vary in the types of normalisation they do, the statistical
    model they use, and the assumptions they make

-   Some of the most well-known methods are provided by: **`DESeq2`**
    [@DESeq2], **`edgeR`** [@robinson2010; @mccarthy2012; @chen2016],
    **`limma`** [@ritchie2015] and **`scran`** [@scran]
:::

## Type of test (the function)

::: incremental

-   **`DESeq2`** and **`edgeR`**
    -   both require raw counts as input
    -   both assume that most genes are not DE
    -   both use a negative binomial distribution[^1] to model the data
    -   use slightly different normalisation methods: **`DESeq2`** uses
        the median of ratios method; **`edgeR`** uses the trimmed mean
        of M values (TMM) method
:::

[^1]: A discrete distribution for counts, similar to the Poisson
    distribution


## Type of test (the function)

-   **`scran`** 
    -   works on normalized log-expression values 
    -   performs Welch t-tests



## Meta data

::: incremental
-   DE methods require two types of data: the expression data and the
    meta data

-   The meta data gives the information about the samples

-   It says which samples (columns of data) are in which treatment group (s)

-   It is usually stored in a separate file
:::

## 🐸 Data

-   Expression for the whole transcriptome [*X. laevis* v10.1 genome
    assembly](https://www.xenbase.org/xenbase/static-xenbase/ftpDatafiles.jsp)

-   Values are raw counts

-   The statistical analysis method we will use **`DESeq2`** [@DESeq2]
    requires raw counts and performs the normalisation itself

## 🎄 Arabidopisis

-   The statistical analysis method we will use **`DESeq2`** [@DESeq2]
    requires raw counts and performs the normalisation itself

## 💉 Leishmania

-   The statistical analysis method we will use **`DESeq2`** [@DESeq2]
    requires raw counts and performs the normalisation itself
    
## 🐭 Data

-   Expression for a *subset* of genes, the surfaceome

-   Values are log2 normalised values

-   The statistical analysis method we will use **`scran`** [@scran]
    requires normalised values


# Adding gene information

## Adding gene information

::: incremental
-   The gene id is difficult to interpret

-   Therefore we need to add information such as the gene name and a
    description to the results

-   🐸 Frog data information comes from Xenbase [@fisher2023]

-   🐭 Mice data information comes from Ensembl [@birney2004]
:::

## 🐸 Xenbase

![xenbase logo](images/Xenbase-Logo-Medium.png){width="800"}

[Xenbase](http://www.xenbase.org/) is a model organism database that
provides genomic, molecular, and developmental biology information about
*Xenopus laevis* and *Xenopus tropicalis*.

. . .

It took me some time to find the information you need.

## 🐸 Xenbase

::: incremental
-   I got the information from the [Xenbase information
    pages](https://www.xenbase.org/xenbase/static-xenbase/ftpDatafiles.jsp)
    under Data Reports \| Gene Information

-   This is listed: Xenbase Gene Product Information \[readme\] [gzipped
    gpi (tab
    separated)](https://download.xenbase.org/xenbase/GenePageReports/xenbase.gpi.gz)

-   Click on the readme link to see the file format and columns

-   I downloaded
    [xenbase.gpi.gz](https://download.xenbase.org/xenbase/GenePageReports/xenbase.gpi.gz),
    unzipped it, removed header lines and the *Xenopus tropicalis*
    (taxon:8364) entries and saved it as
    [xenbase_info.xlsx](meta/xenbase_info.xlsx)

-   In the workshop you will import this file and merge the information
    with the results file
:::

## 🐭 Ensembl

::: incremental
-   [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) creates, integrates
    and distributes reference datasets and analysis tools that enable
    genomics

-   [BioMart](https://grch37.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html) 
    [@smedley2009] provides uniform access to these large datasets

-   **`biomaRt`** [@biomaRt1; @biomaRt2] is a Bioconductor package gives you
    programmatic access to BioMart.

-   In the workshop you use this package to get information you can
    merge with the results file
:::



## Packages

These packages are all on the University computers which you can access on 
campus or [remotely using the VDS](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/tools/vds/)

If you want to use your own machine you will need to install the packages.
::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}

Install **`BiocManager`** from CRAN in the the normal way and set the version of Bioconductor packages to install:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.19")
```

Install **`DESeq2`** from Bioconductor using BiocManager:
```{r}
#| eval: false
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```

Install **`scran`** from Bioconductor using BiocManager:
```{r}
#| eval: false
BiocManager::install("scran")
```

Install **`biomaRt`** from Bioconductor using BiocManager:
```{r}
#| eval: false
BiocManager::install("biomaRt")
```
