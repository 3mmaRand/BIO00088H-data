Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each sample has three replicates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Concentrations are listed here in mM (millimolar, or ""moles / L *  1000 millimoles / 1 moles"")",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CN samples have straw biomass added to AD vials,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NC samples have had water added to AD vials,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,Data for mM to g/l calculations,,,,,,,,
To calculate from this data,,Change in VFA with time,,,,,,,MW (g/mol),60.05,74.08,88.11,88.11,102.13,102.13,116.1583,116.1583
,,"Recalculate the data into grams per liter, and change in VFA g/l with time",,,,,,,,Acetate,Propanoate,Isobutyrate,Butyrate,Isopentanoate,Pentanoate,Isohexanoate,Hexanoate
,,"Calculate the percent representation of each VFA, by mM and by weight",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Useful graphs would include 1) mM or mg/l versus time for VFAs, 2) Delta mg/l versus time for each VFA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
