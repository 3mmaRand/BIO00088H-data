Notes:																	
Each sample has three replicates																	
Concentrations are listed here in mM (millimolar, or "moles / L *  1000 millimoles / 1 moles")																	
CN samples have straw biomass added to AD vials																	
NC samples have had water added to AD vials																	
														
To calculate from this data		Change in VFA with time	
		Recalculate the data into grams per liter, and change in VFA g/l with time
		Calculate the percent representation of each VFA, by mM and by weight				

Data for mM to g/l calculations		

MW (g/mol)	
Acetate	Propanoate	Isobutyrate	Butyrate	Isopentanoate	Pentanoate	Isohexanoate	Hexanoate
60.05	  74.08	      88.11	      88.11	    102.13	      102.13	    116.1583	    116.1583

													
Useful graphs would include 1) mM or mg/l versus time for VFAs, 2) Delta mg/l versus time for each VFA		


They should also be able to do a simple flux measurement:
change in VFA concentration over a period of time, divided by weight or volume of material. 
In this case it might be equal to == 
Delta(Acetate at 3 days - Acetate at 1 day)/ Delta (3days - 1day)/ 50 mls sludge. This would provide a final flux with the units of mg acetate per ml sludge per day.  Let me know if this isn't clear.
-----So I need to add the lag in days. Check the 50mls bit. Is that going to be a constant in the replicate vial? or is it going to be different? .

 
Perhaps more importantly they should be able to graph and extract the reaction rate, assuming a first order chemical/biological reaction and an exponential falloff rate. I found this as a starting point (https://martinlab.chem.umass.edu/r-fitting-data/) , but I assume Emma has something much more effective already in the pipeline.
