You need only do the section for one of the examples.

🐸 Frogs

🎬 Open your `frogs-88H` Project and script you began in the Consolidation study of Transcriptomics 1 and continued to work on in Transcriptomics 2. This is likely to be `cont-fgf-s20.R` or `cont-fgf-s14.R`. Use the code you used in the workshop (in `cont-fgf-s30.R`) as a template to visualise the s20/s14 results. 

🐭 Mice

🎬 Open your `mice-88H` Project and the script you began in the Consolidation study of Transcriptomics 2. This is likely to be `hspc-lthsc.R` or `lthsc-prog.R`. Use the code you used in the workshop (in `hspc-prog.R`) as a template to visualise the hspc-lthsc/lthsc-prog results.
