You need only do the section for one of the examples.

You need only do the section for your own project data

🎄 *Arabidopisis*

🎬 Open your `arab-88H` RStudio Project and the `suff-def-spl7.R` script
you began in the Consolidation study of Transcriptomics 1 and continued
to work on in Transcriptomics 2. Use the code you used in the workshop
(in `suff-def-wild.R`) as a template to visualise the results for the
comparison between the copper sufficient and deficient conditions in
*spl7*.

💉 *Leishmania*

🎬 Open your `leish-88H` RStudio Project and the `pro_ama.R` script you
began in the Consolidation study of Transcriptomics 1 and continued to
work on in Transcriptomics 2. Use the code you used in the workshop (in
`pro_meta.R`) as a template to visualise the results for the comparison
between the procyclic promastigote and amastigote stages.

🐭 Stem cells

🎬 Open your `mice-88H` RStudio Project and the `hspc-lthsc.R` script
you began in the Consolidation study of Transcriptomics 1 and continued
to work on in Transcriptomics 2. Use the code you used in the workshop
(in `hspc-prog.R`) as a template to visualise the results for the
comparison between HSPC and LT-HSPC cells
