This week we cover how to visualise the results of your differential expression analysis. The independent study will allow you to check you have what you should have following the [Transcriptomics 2: Statistical Analysis workshop](../week-4/workshop.html) and [Consolidation study](../week-4/study_after_workshop.html). It will also summarise the the methods and plots we will go through in the workshop. It will also explain
how to write the methods for the analyses with have conducted. In the workshop, we will learn how to carry out and plot a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) as well as how to create a nicely formatted Volcano plot. 

The plots you have by the end of this week will be suitable for including in your report.

We suggest you sit together with your group in the workshop.

### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   verify they have the required RStudio Project set up and the data and code files from the previous Workshop and Consolidation study
-   perform a PCA and understand how to interpret them
-   create a volcano plot and understand how to interpret them
-   write the methods for the analyses they have conducted
  

### Instructions
