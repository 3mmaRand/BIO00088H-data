You need only do the section for your own project data

🐸 Frog development

🎬 Open your `frogs-88H` Project. Make a new script and, using 
`cont-fgf-s30.R` as a template, repeat the analysis on one of 
the other comparisons. It does not matter which one you choose. I recommend
making a new script.


🐭 Stem cells

🎬 Open your `mice-88H` Project. Open your `hspc-prog.R` script and, 
using your code working with the hspc cells as a template, repeat 
the analysis on the prog cells. Add the code to `hspc-prog.R` as you will
later add the statistical comparison between these cell types.
