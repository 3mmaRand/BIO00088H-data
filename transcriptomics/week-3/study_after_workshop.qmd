You need only do the section for your own project data

## 🐸 Frog development

🎬 Open your `frogs-88H` Project. Make a new script and, using 
`cont-fgf-s30.R` as a template, repeat the analysis stage 20. I recommend 
making a new script.

## 🎄 Arabidopisis

🎬 Open your `arab-88H` Project. Make a new script and, using 
`suff-def-wild.R` as a template, repeat the analysis on the *spl7* mutants. 
I recommend making a new script.


## 💉 Leishmania

🎬 Open your `leish-88H` Project. Make a new script and, using 
`pro_meta.R` as a template, repeat the analysis on the 
procyclic promastigotes (pro) and amastigotes (ama) 
I recommend making a new script.

## 🐭 Stem cells

🎬 Open your `mice-88H` Project. Open your `hspc-prog.R` script and, 
using your code working with the hspc cells as a template, repeat 
the analysis on the prog cells. Add the code to `hspc-prog.R` as you will
later add the statistical comparison between these cell types.
